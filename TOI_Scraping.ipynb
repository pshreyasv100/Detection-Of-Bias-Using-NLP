      "1\t    NEW DELHI: The US on Thursday reaffirmed its commitment to help India join the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), reported news agency ANI.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  \n",
      "  \"We are working with partners to secure India's Nuclear Suppliers Group membership,\" said Kenneth Juster, the American ambassador to India, in his inaugural policy speech.\n",
      "     It is noteworthy that Juster went on to describe India as a \"leading power\" in the Indo-Pacific region.\n",
      "     \"India is a leading power in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond. For India and the US, Indo-Pacific is vital for the security and prosperity of our people as well as others. Together we want to ensure a free and open region, where rule of law and democratic principles are reflected,\" he said.\n",
      "     \"We want to promote respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, guarantee freedom of navigation over flight and commerce and other lawful uses of the sea, ensure territorial and maritime disputes are resolved peacefully consistent with international laws,\" he added.\n",
      "     Juster was at pains to clarify that 'America First' and 'Make in India' were \"not incompatible.\" Instead, he said, the two had the potential to be \"mutually beneficial, increase economic interactions and volume of trade.\"\n",
      "     In fact, he went as far as to suggest that India emerge an as \"alternative hub\" to China for US businesses in the region.\n",
      "     He also echoed President Donald Trump's belief that India play a bigger role in Afghanistan, even as he stressed that the situation would not improve till \"Pakistan does not contribute positively.\"\n",
      "     \"(There are a) Few areas of collaboration. One is Afghanistan, where we both have a strong interest in promoting peace, security and prosperity. Our leaders are committed to supporting Afghanistan and helping build that country's democratic institutions. Pakistan is also important to the situation in Afghanistan. I don't think we are going to get stability and security in Afghanistan if Pakistan does not contribute positively to that,\" he said.\n",
      "     He reaffirmed the American position that the leaders of Pakistan had not \"done all that they could\" to rid it of safe havens for terror, and this had led to suspension of security assistance.\n",
      "     \"President Trump and other US leaders have been clear that we will not tolerate cross-border terrorism or terrorist safe havens anywhere. As part of this effort, last month we launched the first-ever US-India Counter-Terrorism Designations Dialogue,\" he added.\n",
      "     Juster also attempted to ease worries about the immigration issue in the US, that came to the fore with last year's Presidential election in the country.\n",
      "     \"US is probably as open a country as any in the world and we probably take more immigrants per year compared to any other country. We are a country of immigrants and that has helped drive our economy, made us what we are. That is not going to change,\" he said.\n",

      "2\t    NEW DELHI: After China put up a virtually permanent roadblock for proscribing\n",
      "  Masood Azhar+\n",
      "  by the UNSC, India and US are mulling options for their next steps.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  \n",
      "  In December, Indian and US officials will meet for the first time for a dialogue on coordinating terrorist designations by both countries. The two sides will discuss options of keeping terrorists and terror groups like Jaish-e-Muhammad under pressure.\n",
      "     This will include discussions on the next terrorist that will be put up for sanctions by the UNSC's 1267 committee.\n",
      "     The new consultation mechanism was decided during the Modi-Trump summit this summer. In the joint statement that followed the summit, both sides, \"committed to strengthen cooperation against terrorist threats from groups including al-Qaida, ISIS, JeM, Lashkar-e-Taiba, D-Company, and their affiliates. ... the leaders welcomed a new consultation mechanism on domestic and international terrorist designations listing proposals.\"\n",
      "     For instance, Abdul Rauf Asghar, Masood Azhar's brother, may find his name on the next list for sanctions. He was charged in the Pathankot terror attack. Azhar's second brother, Maulana Ibrahim Athar Alvi is accused of masterminding the IC-814 hijack which forced India to release Azhar from jail in return for the passengers of the jet.\n",
      "     India has a list of other terror leaders operating with the support of Pakistan's military-intelligence establishment, who India wants to put up on the 1267 committee.\n",
      "     India wants China to continue to shield Pakistan at the multilateral level — if Beijing blocks sanctions against deadly terrorists repeatedly, it could succeed in painting itself as a supporter of global terrorism. Chinese officials reportedly expressed confidence that they would not be pressured on Azhar by the US given the US needed their support on keeping an increasingly hostile North Korea in check. China's decision came even as Beijing itself demanded extra security from Pakistan for its new envoy from ETIM terrorists — many of them trained in Pakistan.\n",
      "     The joint statement added that India and United States would work together to \"prevent terrorist travel and to disrupt global recruitment efforts by expanding intelligence-sharing and operational-level counterterrorism cooperation.\"\n",
      "     As part of the travel vetting programmesin both countries, India and US had also decided to exchange information on \"known and suspected terrorists for travel screening.\" The likes of David Headley, who conducted numerous reconnaissance trips to India to prepare for the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, could appear on the Indian security radar.\n",

      "3\t    UNITED NATIONS: Pakistan needs to change its \"mindset\" of differentiating between good and bad terrorists, India said at the UN Security Council, urging it to focus on challenges posed by terrorism\n",

      "     He added that New Delhi remain committed to work closely with its regional and international partners to bring peace, security, stability and prosperity in Afghanistan.\n",
      "     Earlier, the US told the UN Security Council that the status quo regarding terrorist safe havens in Pakistan is not acceptable.\n",
      "   The US had said+\n",
      "  that the status quo regarding continued terror safe havens in Pakistan is not acceptable and insisted that Islamabad join its efforts to bring a resolution to the conflict.\n",
      "   \n",
      "UN chief calls for 'balance of power' in UNSC    \"We seek to work cohesively and effectively with Pakistan, but cannot be successful if the status quo, one where terrorist organisations are given sanctuary inside the country's borders, is allowed to continue,\" US deputy secretary of state John Sullivan told the ministerial meeting.\n",
      "     Afghan deputy foreign minister Hekmat Khalil Karzai too reiterated the presence of terrorist safe haven in Pakistan.\n",
      "     Meanwhile, Pakistan continued to be in denial.\n",
      "     Permanent Representative of Pakistan to the UN Maleeha Lodhi, responding to the Indian ambassador,\n",
      "  raked up the case of Jadhav+\n",
      "  , who was captured in March last year and sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court for alleged spying, an accusation that India has dismissed as concocted.\n",
      "     \"Those who talk of changing mindset need to look within, at their own record of subversion against my country as our capture of an Indian spy has proven beyond doubt,\" Lodhi told the members of the UN Security Council, without naming Jadhav.\n",

      "8\t    GURUGRAM: We're all accustomed to looking up at architecture. But would our perspective change if we instead directed our gaze downwards? \"It's a radical way of looking, with which most of us are unfamiliar,\" explained Victoria Lautman. A Chicago-based broadcast journalist, writer and lecturer, Lautman was in town to talk about the vanishing stepwells of India (on which she has written a book).\n",
      "  \n",
      "  \n",
      "  The topic takes on new meaning in the light of recent efforts to save a 113-year-old baoli in Badshapur from being knocked down. \"When I heard about it, I was determined to see it,\" she said of the structure just off Sohna Road.\n",
      "     Rudabai Vav was the first stepwell Lautman encountered, some 30 years ago, and her fascination for these underground wonders has not dulled. \"As I descended, the heat from the Gujarati sun became cool, the light became dim, the sounds became hushed,\" she recalled. \"It was as if I had entered a different realm - it was also very disorienting!\"\n",
      "     Stepwells are unique to the subcontinent, but today they're just \"background noise\", relics of the past obscured by urban clutter. They've been encroached on, and conveniently used as waste dumps. \"They're everywhere and hiding in plain sight. Tourists can be 100 yards from one but would have no idea they're there.\" More reason, then, for guidebooks to rhapsodise their stories.\n",
      "     But once upon a time, Lautman reminded everyone, baolis brought communities together. \"They were enchanted environments,\" she said evocatively. They had a function that went beyond just that of harvesting water. Stepwells were also subterranean temples, and places where folks could congregate socially. They acted as posts on remote trade routes, providing a readily available supply of water for pilgrims, travellers and merchants.\n",
      "     \"They are some of the most unique structures on earth but, inexplicably, stepwells have disappeared from architectural typology,\" regrets Lautman. Yet if they can't be restored to former glory, they can, she believes, be creatively and adaptively reused, which would help extend their lifespans.\n",
      "     Convincing villagers, however, that a stepwell is of practical use, and guaranteeing them custodianship of this piece of physical history, is key to preservation. \"Because getting a community to care about a heritage structure is very difficult, so getting villagers on board is important.\"\n",
      "     Ultimately, Indians should really be assuming more responsibility towards their own heritage. \"I shouldn't be doing this, documenting your culture to show you what I value, what you should value,\" said Lautman.\n",
      "     Meanwhile, her love affair with India's stepwells continues. \"I want to see every baoli I hear about and have access to!\" said Lautman, speaking at the Sushant School of Art and Architecture, Ansal University.\n",
      "     Stepwells come in different sizes and dimensions (some have multiple entrances). They can be linear, L-shaped, circular, cylindrical, square or octagonal. Among the most famous ones are Chand Baori (Abhaneri, Rajasthan), Rudabai Vav (Adalaj, Gujarat), Rani ki Vav (Patan, Gujarat - a UNESCO World Heritage Site) and Mukundpura Baoli (Narnaul, Haryana).\n",

      "     \"But since we moved to India, we have achieved big. We were associates and playing in a lower tier when practising in Pakistan. Since we moved to India we are performing well. We have reached a stage where we are playing with the best.\"\n",
      "     \"So, comparatively, it is bigger. Financially it is helping us quite a lot. It is cost effective in comparison to playing in UAE. Conditions wise too it is good. It is easy to convince other boards to come and play in India. So, from different perspective, it is better to play in India,\" said the CEO.\n",
      "     Fittingly, Afghanistan would be playing their maiden Test in Bengaluru from June 14 to 18. The ACB is also close to getting a second home ground in India, most likely in Dehradun.\n",
      "     It is also in talks with the BCCI for facilitating junior tours.\n",
      "     \"I have requested the BCCI and they have agreed to support us in junior cricket (U17, emerging and A teams). Integrate education as well with tours. In principle, we are in agreement. We need to work on the composition of the competition,\" he said.\n",
      "     Afghan players in the IPL too have helped spread the sport's popularity in the country. Last year, Rashid Khan and Mohammad Nabi became the first two players from Afghanistan to be bought at an IPL auction.\n",
      "     \"IPL played a huge role in getting the game popular back home. We don't have just one Rashid Khan, we have so many Rashid Khans in every part of the country,\" he added.\n",
