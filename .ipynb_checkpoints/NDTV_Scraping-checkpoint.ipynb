      "[Beijing: HighlightsIndo-US ties key to Mr Trump's policy to 'suppress' China: Chinese media Ties won't impact China due to India's internal problems: Global Times China attacked Donald Trump after he questioned China on several issues                                  The Indo-US relations will become an important part of President-elect Donald Trump's diplomacy to \"suppress\" China, but it will have limited impact on Beijing due New Delhi's resistance to a quasi-alliance\" with Washington to retain an independent foreign policy, the Chinese state media said today.The opinion piece titled 'Trump may be cool to alliance with Delhi' said, \"With the purpose of stabilising the external situation and straightening out problems at home, the Trump administration will seek an improving relationship with India,\" an article in the state-run Global Times said today.The commentary however said that India will not be able to assist the US much due to its own domestic problems, and US's enthusiasm thus to build a quasi-alliance will decrease.It further said that India \"as a global power sticking to non-alignment diplomacy\" will not set a goal of \"allying with the US in suppressing China as the US hopes\".\"Therefore, there are unbridgeable differences between American intentions for developing a close relationship with India to balance China and India's concept of developing independent diplomacy toward the US and China,\" the article said.When dealing with global challenges such as climate change, nuclear proliferation and terrorism, the US may require India to make greater contributions to specific fields which only the US is concerned about, it said.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"adslotNativeVideo\"); });\"His will reduce India's trust in the US, and weaken the basis for deepening bilateral cooperation to the level the US looks forward to,\" it said.Detailing limitations of US-India relations under the Trump administration, the article said it will have a \"limited impact on China\".

Second deepening cooperation on defense trade and third broadening in security partnership,\" said Lavoy, Senior Director for South Asia at the National Security Council (NSC), said in his remarks at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). During the past six years of Obama Administration, he said there has been growing convergence of views of the risks, threats and opportunities.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"adslotNativeVideo\"); });\"In part this convergence has come apart as we made monumental efforts to overcome specific areas of mistrust,\" he said, adding that over the years the two countries have built habits of co-operation in discussing the challenge they face.Three regions where this co-operation has gained momentum are Afghanistan, Asia Pacific and Africa, he said.Maritime security is the key area of co-operation between the two countries.Over the last few years, the US has significantly increased its consultations with India on their shared interest in Afghanistan, he said.India, he said has played an important role in the collective effort of bringing stability and prosperity to that war-torn country, committing more than USD 2 billion in assistance.The Commander of US forces in Afghanistan now regularly travels to New Delhi to exchange views with Indian leaders, he said.Lavoy said it is fair to say that the US India defense relationship has matured in the last eight years than any period in US history.In April, Defence Secretary returned to India for an unprecedented third visit in less than a year.\"There is no country in the world that we are supporting in this manner as an emerging global defense leader. This is unique,\" the White House official said on the growing India US defence relationship.\"Never in our history we have supported an indigenous aircraft program in any other country,\" he said.Lavoy said India US cooperation on counter terrorism has become a crucial pillar of a broader strategic partnership.This is fitting as the US and India view acts of terrorism as threat to global peace and security but also to their common values of democracy, justice, the rule of law and the protection of every individual.\"The United States has come a long way in security partnership with India. One of the sustaining strength of this relationship is not underpinned by this treaty, but by our common interest and values. It is voluntary and it continues to grow. This strategic logic is simple, it is bipartisan in both nations,\" he said.Lavoy said he would like the two countries to adopt more practical collaboration in all domain, in space, in the air, on the sea, under the sea, on land and on multilateral forums, in ways that respects India's sovereignty but also reflects their status as increasingly close partners who tackle problems side by side.Today India does count in world affairs, but it has taken a long time for India's aspiration to realise, he said as he recollected a 1949 speech of the first Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. CommentsClose [X]\"It is the most dynamic relationship that we have today. Each of the things that we are doing enables us to take this to the next level and have to simultaneously work on expanding the partnership in new domain,\" Lavoy said in response to a question.\"This is a unique relationship worldwide where we can't choose between deepening and broadening. We have to do both simultaneously,\" he added. ]\n",

There are 110,000 Indian-origin doctors in the US, he said, adding that recent statistics show that every seventh patient in the US is seen by an Indian doctor.Forty per cent of the all hotel rooms in the US are owned and managed by people of Indian-origin, generating $13 billion to the US economy, he said.Not only this, every year about 140,000 Indian students come to the US for higher studies bringing is about $4.5 billion to the US economy, he said.\"So it's a huge engagement with US institutions,\" Mr Singh said at the reception hosted by Indian-American Forum for Political Education headed by Dr Sampat Shivangi, an eminent Republican from Mississippi.Referring to the number of meetings he had in Cleveland with the top leadership of the Republican party on the sidelines of its convention, he said this reflects their interest in India-US relationship.\"I believe all of you will have an important role to play in contributing to this. All of you in a sense are permanent Ambassadors here. You have an understanding of the US. You have an understanding of India and Indian society. So based on this understanding and the network that you have you will be in a position to take forward this relationship in different areas,\" Mr Singh said.Ms Shivangi said there is a very positive momentum on India-US relationship, particularly after the recent visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Referring to the Republican platform passed by early this week, India-US relationship would strengthen further and reach a new height under the next Republican president.India US relationship has a bipartisan support and would deepen further if the party is voted to power to the White House coming November, he said.

I think, what I always used (the term) is partnership. It is a partnership that has grown. We have transformed the relationship. But that has been bipartisan,\" Mr Menon said.Mr Menon, whose first book post retirement 'Choices: Inside the making of India's Foreign Policy' is all set to hit book stores globally next week, said that each of the successive Indian governments in the last few decades have done their bit to take the relationship further forward.\"The first NDA government led by the Prime Minister (Atal Bihari) Vajpayee did the Next Steps in Strategic Partnership, which actually opened up defence co-operation and various cooperation in space and various sensitive forms of cooperation.\"The UPA government did the civil nuclear which again removed the biggest obstacle and changed the mindset actually in India and the US about the relationship.

It's new for both of us,\" he said.\"The US is used to having allies who follow or clients who obey. Partners are equal. And partners each bring different things to the table and work together. I think, we are learning how to do it,\" Mr Menon said.\"If you look at maritime security, counter-terrorism, intelligence, look at various aspects of national security, defence co-operation, DTTI for instance, many of these things are unprecedented. But we are learning how to build a partnership,\" he said.\"We are at a stage where partnership, relationship has been better than it has been ever been before, but there is still a way to go.

He should instead strengthen India's alliance to cope up with the challenges posed by China,\" Mr Tellis, a senior fellow South Asia Programme at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a top American think-tank, said in an article.Mumbai-born Ashley Tellis, 55, in an op-ed published in Asia Policy by the National Bureau of Asian Research, said, the variety of positions expressed by Trump suggests that the potential threat to the continuing transformation of US-India relations comes less from his views on India- which are probably unsettled- than it does from his iconoclastic convictions about the relationship between the US and the world.He argues that while many elements of Trump's nationalist agenda are understandable - even defensible - the worldview it represents diverges from that which initially cultured the evolving US-Indian partnership.\"Going back to the earliest years of the George W Bush administration, the US' rapprochement with India was premised on the assumption that the principle strategic problem facing both countries consisted of the rise of China and the threat it posed to both US primacy and Indian security- not to mention the safety of the US' other Asian partner and allies - simultaneously,\" he wrote.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"adslotNativeVideo\"); });\"Since it was assumed that the United States would subsist as the principal protector of the liberal international order, and the Western alliance system in particular, even in circumstances where the containment of China was impossible because of the new realities of economic interdependence, the Bush administration slowly gravitated toward a strategy of balancing China by building up the power of key states located on its periphery,\" Mr Tellis said.He says the current US commitment to the rise of Indian power sans symmetric reciprocity was devised during the Bush administration but has been faithfully continued by President Barack Obama for very good reasons.It was anchored in the presumption that helping India expand in power and prosperity served the highest geopolitical interests of the US in Asia and globally-namely, maintaining a balance of power that advantaged the liberal democracies, he said.\"Accordingly, it justified acts of extraordinary US generosity toward India, even if specific policies emanating from New Delhi did not always dovetail with Washington's preferences,\" Mr Tellis said in the article.\"Given that what India could become -a power capable of successfully balancing a rising China- mattered more for US interests than what New Delhi did on any other issue, US policy for almost two decades has embodied a calculated altruism whereby Washington continually seeks to bolster India's national capabilities without any expectations of direct recompense,\" he said.Tellis warns that if New Delhi fails to satisfy the anticipation of reciprocity embodied by an America-first policy -a likely prospect given India's resource and power constraints - both nations will have ended up worse off. \"Without the benefit of a preferential affiliation with the US, India's challenges with regard to managing a rising China (and even a troublesome Pakistan) will have become considerably more difficult,\" he said.

He should instead strengthen India's alliance to cope up with the challenges posed by China,\" Mr Tellis, a senior fellow South Asia Programme at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a top American think-tank, said in an article.Mumbai-born Ashley Tellis, 55, in an op-ed published in Asia Policy by the National Bureau of Asian Research, said, the variety of positions expressed by Trump suggests that the potential threat to the continuing transformation of US-India relations comes less from his views on India- which are probably unsettled- than it does from his iconoclastic convictions about the relationship between the US and the world.He argues that while many elements of Trump's nationalist agenda are understandable - even defensible - the worldview it represents diverges from that which initially cultured the evolving US-Indian partnership.\"Going back to the earliest years of the George W Bush administration, the US' rapprochement with India was premised on the assumption that the principle strategic problem facing both countries consisted of the rise of China and the threat it posed to both US primacy and Indian security- not to mention the safety of the US' other Asian partner and allies - simultaneously,\" he wrote.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"adslotNativeVideo\"); });\"Since it was assumed that the United States would subsist as the principal protector of the liberal international order, and the Western alliance system in particular, even in circumstances where the containment of China was impossible because of the new realities of economic interdependence, the Bush administration slowly gravitated toward a strategy of balancing China by building up the power of key states located on its periphery,\" Mr Tellis said.He says the current US commitment to the rise of Indian power sans symmetric reciprocity was devised during the Bush administration but has been faithfully continued by President Barack Obama for very good reasons.It was anchored in the presumption that helping India expand in power and prosperity served the highest geopolitical interests of the US in Asia and globally-namely, maintaining a balance of power that advantaged the liberal democracies, he said.\"Accordingly, it justified acts of extraordinary US generosity toward India, even if specific policies emanating from New Delhi did not always dovetail with Washington's preferences,\" Mr Tellis said in the article.\"Given that what India could become -a power capable of successfully balancing a rising China- mattered more for US interests than what New Delhi did on any other issue, US policy for almost two decades has embodied a calculated altruism whereby Washington continually seeks to bolster India's national capabilities without any expectations of direct recompense,\" he said.Tellis warns that if New Delhi fails to satisfy the anticipation of reciprocity embodied by an America-first policy -a likely prospect given India's resource and power constraints - both nations will have ended up worse off. \"Without the benefit of a preferential affiliation with the US, India's challenges with regard to managing a rising China (and even a troublesome Pakistan) will have become considerably more difficult,\" he said. CommentsClose  X \"The United States in turn will have lost the opportunity to preserve an advantageous Asian balance of power, which by incorporating a strengthened India actually constrains Chinese ambitions and thereby buttresses US primacy for more time to come,\" Mr Tellis added.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)  12\t New Delhi:                             India should guard against \"judging\" US President Donald Trump in a \"rush\" and instead take him seriously, Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar said on Tuesday.

Obviously, the president is enormously proud of his record of working closely with Prime Minister Modi,\" he said.\"They've worked together on a number of projects, most recently the Paris agreement, that a lot of the work that went into that, again was a deal brokered between nearly 200 countries, but India was a vital part of that.\"And that could not have been done without Prime Minister Modi's leadership,\" Mr Schultz said.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"adslotNativeVideo\"); }); CommentsClose  X   20\t Washington:                             The US has ruled out any kind of treaty alliance with India, saying the 21st century is not an era of alliances and a mutual agreeable concept of major defence partner is a very apt description for India.\"21st century is not an era of alliances. It is an era of identifying interest, common values and working together in solving all those problems. I do not think that anyone in the United States Government or the Indian Government has any compulsion at all to form a treaty alliance,\" said Peter Lavoy, Senior Director for South Asia at the National Security Council (NSC), White House.He was responding to a question at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a top American think-tank.\"Why have that shackle (of being a treaty alliance). I think, the friends that benefit from that are probably satisfactory. I would highlight a phrase that should not be underestimates - Major Defence Partner (with India),\" he said.\"There was an understanding, growing perception that we have been doing so much together that we have expanded, deepened the boundaries of co-operation. But there was no brand or phrase or some term that qualified what this relationship is about. I think, the mutual agreeable concept of major defence partner is a very apt description,\" he said.\"It was largely driven by the extent of deepening co-operation. India achieves success rate of 99 per cent in licenses applied for. That is really astounding. Other kinds of technology is being transferred much more easily and readily than ever before. So there are very significant changes to our own policies and rules and procedures that enabled this defence partnership,\" Lavoy said.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"adslotNativeVideo\"); });Lavoy said even before India places a request for something, the United States is ready and prepared.\"Well before a challenge arise, we are already working with India to try to prevent the things from occurring,\" he said.

Second deepening cooperation on defense trade and third broadening in security partnership,\" said Lavoy, Senior Director for South Asia at the National Security Council (NSC), said in his remarks at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). During the past six years of Obama Administration, he said there has been growing convergence of views of the risks, threats and opportunities.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"adslotNativeVideo\"); });\"In part this convergence has come apart as we made monumental efforts to overcome specific areas of mistrust,\" he said, adding that over the years the two countries have built habits of co-operation in discussing the challenge they face.Three regions where this co-operation has gained momentum are Afghanistan, Asia Pacific and Africa, he said.Maritime security is the key area of co-operation between the two countries.Over the last few years, the US has significantly increased its consultations with India on their shared interest in Afghanistan, he said.India, he said has played an important role in the collective effort of bringing stability and prosperity to that war-torn country, committing more than USD 2 billion in assistance.The Commander of US forces in Afghanistan now regularly travels to New Delhi to exchange views with Indian leaders, he said.Lavoy said it is fair to say that the US India defense relationship has matured in the last eight years than any period in US history.In April, Defence Secretary returned to India for an unprecedented third visit in less than a year.\"There is no country in the world that we are supporting in this manner as an emerging global defense leader. This is unique,\" the White House official said on the growing India US defence relationship.\"Never in our history we have supported an indigenous aircraft program in any other country,\" he said.Lavoy said India US cooperation on counter terrorism has become a crucial pillar of a broader strategic partnership.This is fitting as the US and India view acts of terrorism as threat to global peace and security but also to their common values of democracy, justice, the rule of law and the protection of every individual.\"The United States has come a long way in security partnership with India. One of the sustaining strength of this relationship is not underpinned by this treaty, but by our common interest and values. It is voluntary and it continues to grow. This strategic logic is simple, it is bipartisan in both nations,\" he said.Lavoy said he would like the two countries to adopt more practical collaboration in all domain, in space, in the air, on the sea, under the sea, on land and on multilateral forums, in ways that respects India's sovereignty but also reflects their status as increasingly close partners who tackle problems side by side.Today India does count in world affairs, but it has taken a long time for India's aspiration to realise, he said as he recollected a 1949 speech of the first Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.

Each of the things that we are doing enables us to take this to the next level and have to simultaneously work on expanding the partnership in new domain,\" Lavoy said in response to a question.\"This is a unique relationship worldwide where we can't choose between deepening and broadening. We have to do both simultaneously,\" he added.   22\t Cleveland:                             The 3.5 million Indian-American community has an important role to play in strengthening Indo-US ties, Indian Ambassador to the US Arun K Singh said, underlining that people-to-people contact is a key dimension of the bilateral relationship.\"I think, what gives a real, solid and fundamental basis to the (India-US) relationship is the people-to-people dimension of the relationship,\" Mr Singh told members of the Indian-American community in Cleveland and those attending Republican National Convention at a reception hosted in his honour.At present there are 3.5 million Indian-Americans in the US and they are all over the US. There are 110,000 Indian-origin doctors in the US, he said, adding that recent statistics show that every seventh patient in the US is seen by an Indian doctor.Forty per cent of the all hotel rooms in the US are owned and managed by people of Indian-origin, generating $13 billion to the US economy, he said.Not only this, every year about 140,000 Indian students come to the US for higher studies bringing is about $4.5 billion to the US economy, he said.\"So it's a huge engagement with US institutions,\" Mr Singh said at the reception hosted by Indian-American Forum for Political Education headed by Dr Sampat Shivangi, an eminent Republican from Mississippi.Referring to the number of meetings he had in Cleveland with the top leadership of the Republican party on the sidelines of its convention, he said this reflects their interest in India-US relationship.\"I believe all of you will have an important role to play in contributing to this. All of you in a sense are permanent Ambassadors here. You have an understanding of the US. You have an understanding of India and Indian society. So based on this understanding and the network that you have you will be in a position to take forward this relationship in different areas,\" Mr Singh said.Ms Shivangi said there is a very positive momentum on India-US relationship, particularly after the recent visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Referring to the Republican platform passed by early this week, India-US relationship would strengthen further and reach a new height under the next Republican president.India US relationship has a bipartisan support and would deepen further if the party is voted to power to the White House coming November, he said.

Despite its best effort, the Obama administration could not get the job done due to opposition from China. The baton now has been passed on to the Trump administration.\"We have worked and continue to work closely with our Indian counterparts and the NSG Participating Governments to help advance India's case for membership,\" the State Department official said, indicating that there has been no change in the US policy towards India's NSG membership bid under the Trump administration.The key to India's membership now lies with China. However, it is not clear if new US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who would be in China this week, would be raising this issue with the Chinese leadership or if President Donald Trump is ready to take up the issue himself as was done by President George Bush.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"adslotNativeVideo\"); }); CommentsClose  X Trump is set to host his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in Florida next month.In January, the then South and Central Asia point person of the Obama administration, Nisha Desai Biswal, had described China as an \"outlier\" on the NSG issue.  24\t Washington: HighlightsThe move comes after US designated India a 'major defence partner'. The US has not made a formal decision yet. The Guardian, made by General Atomics, has cutting edge technologies.                                  The US is likely to respond positively to India's request for 22 unarmed high-tech multi-mission Predator Guardian drones for maritime surveillance, especially in the Indian Ocean. The move comes after India was designated a 'major defence partner' of the US in June.Within weeks of that designation, after Prime Minister Narendra Modi met US President Barack Obama at the White House in early June, the Indian Navy had sent an official letter of request (LoR) in February to Department of Defense towards purchase of 22 high-tech multi-mission Predator Guardian UAVs.This was the first major request of arms sale purchase by India after Obama designated New Delhi as a major 'strategic defence partner'.The US government has not made a formal decision on it yet, but is believed to have started an inter agency process on the Indian request.According to sources, the administration believes that an approval of such a major military sale would help in \"sealing Indian US defence relationship\", bring in \"a new level of comfort\" between the two militaries and would be considered as a lasting legacy not only for India but also for the Asia-Pacific pivot of the outgoing president.Officials in Washington believe that the sale of predator Guardian UAVs would act as a force multiplier for India's maritime surveillance capabilities in the Indian Ocean region, which of late has become one of the key American objective in the Asia Pacific region.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"adslotNativeVideo\"); });Top governmental sources confirmed that Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar and US Defence Secretary Ashton Carter had detailed discussions on predator Guardian UAV to fulfill maritime surveillance requirements.Mr Parrikar was in the US last week and held meetings with Carter at the Pentagon on August 29.During the meeting, Carter is understood have assured Mr Parrikar that he would personally \"champion\" India's request \"within the system,\" sources said.Sources indicate along with the White House, the Pentagon and some influential members of the US are keen to complete the process as soon as possible before Obama leaves his presidency next January. CommentsClose  X However, a section within the State Department have to be convinced that this is in the interest of the US national security as well. This maritime capability will be a force multiplier for the Indian Navy who has procured other advance technologies including Boeing P-8 aircraft.The Guardian, manufactured by General Atomics, has cutting edge technologies that do not do not exist in the current Indian Navy arsenal.  25\t   26\t Washington:                             With just 100 days left in Barack Obama's presidency, a top American think-tank has suggested the new US President should meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi within the first 100 days to strongly signal the importance of continuing close relations between the two countries.In a major report on 'India-US Security Co-operation', the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) urges the upcoming administration to ensure that India signs the foundational agreements, which it believes is important for strengthening the India-US defence relationship.\"The absence of such agreements will also make it nearly impossible (if not completely impossible) for the US to provide to India certain advanced sensing, computing and communications technologies that India believes are necessary for its own defence capabilities,\" it said.\"The next administration should work with Australia, India and Japan to establish a quadrilateral security dialogue, led by the US State Department and foreign ministries. The dialogue should focus on issues of common interest across the Pacific and Indian Ocean regions,\" the report said.It said creating a specific opportunity for the US President and Prime Minister Modi to meet in the first 100 days will send a strong signal about the importance of bilateral ties.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"adslotNativeVideo\"); });CSIS in its report recommends that the US and India should deepen announced efforts on submarine safety and anti-submarine warfare to include combined training and exercises to expand the capability of both countries as well as their inter-operability with each other.Seeking to increase the FDI limit in the defence sector to 100 per cent, the report also calls for strengthening and expanding the homeland security dialogue.The think-tank recommends the new president should invite India to participate (as an observer or stakeholder) in the Quadrilateral Coordination Group talks with the Taliban.It also urges for establishing a US-India dialogue on the Middle East, modeled on the \"East Asia Consults\" of the US State Department and India's Ministry of External Affairs.CSIS said PM Modi's emergence as a strong leader, just as the US was seeking to consolidate its strategy of re-balance to the Asia Pacific, gave America an opportunity to engage with a rising leader in India, and India an opportunity to reprioritise and rethink its engagement with the world. CommentsClose  X President Obama continues a bipartisan run of three presidents who have seen India as key to US strategy in Asia, it said.Observing that President Obama has built a strong relationship with PM Modi, and maintained a high tempo of engagements at the highest levels, the report said the US engagement with India has increasingly focused on the security aspects and India has responded with uncharacteristic warmth to this outreach.   27\t Washington:                             There is a strong appetite within the region, an influential US lawmaker has said, while making it clear that such a role does come with \"responsibilities\".Congressman Matt Salmon, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific Holds Hearing on Asia Policy, said this during a Congressional hearing.\"As India seeks to garner closer commercial and defence relations with the US, it must take steps toward important reforms that will lay the foundation for increased ties,\" Mr Salmon said. CommentsClose  X The Obama Administration, he said, has \"half-heartedly\" sought to include India in its pivot.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"adslotNativeVideo\"); });\"But the deep well of potential in our bilateral ties remains untapped. India struggles with infrastructure challenges, energy issues and difficult neighbours. But the two world's largest democracies are natural partners,\" Mr Salmon said.  28\t Washington:                             US President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi are committed to building an \"ambitious\" partnership that benefits not just their countries but also other nations working towards peace and stability, America's top diplomat said today.US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told a Washington audience that PM Modi's visit in June highlighted the many areas of cooperation that are already underway in this new era of strategic relationship between India and the United States.\"President Trump and Prime Minister Modi are committed more than any of our leaders before them - to building an ambitious partnership that benefits not only our two great democracies but other sovereign nations working toward greater peace and stability,\" said Tillerson in a major India policy speech before CSIS, a top US think-tank.Tillerson is scheduled to visit India next week.\"My visit could not come at a more promising time for the US-India partnership. As you know, this year marks the 70th anniversary of relations between our two countries,\" he said.Tillerson said his relationship with India goes back to 1998, when he began working on issues related to India's energy security and has made many trips to Delhi.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"adslotNativeVideo\"); });\"It was a privilege to do business with Indian counterparts then, and it has been my great honour this year to work with Indian leaders as Secretary of State. I look forward to returning to Delhi next week, for the first time in my official capacity,\" Tillerson said.Referring to the fact that earlier this month, a shipment of American crude oil arrived in India, Tillerson said it was a tangible illustration of India and the US expanding their energy cooperation.The Trump Administration is determined to dramatically deepen ways for the US and India to work together, he asserted.Noting that more than 600 American companies operate in India, Tillerson said the US foreign direct investment has jumped by 500 per cent in the past two years alone.The bilateral trade hit a record of roughly $115 billion last year, a number US plans to increase, he said.

But I know that they have requested more and would like more and I think there is an immediate need for more as these aircraft can immediately get into the fight,\" he said, when asked whether Afghanistan was seeking more military helicopters from India apart from the four Mi 25 choppers.He said Afghanistan was struggling to get spare parts for Russian aircraft due to Western sanctions against Moscow and India can supply them, adding \"the US favours India's military support to Afghanistan\".Referring to Pakistan, he said the Taliban \"enjoys sanctuaries\" in Pakistan and that the US has asked Islamabad to take steps to contain the terror networks operating from its soil.\"We consistently encourage Pakistan to take action against terrorist groups that operate from its territory and close down their safe havens,\" he told a group of journalists, at the same time, adding that the US was supportive of Islamabad's efforts to reduce the ability of terrorist groups.Nicholson said the US was trying to build a \"counter terrorism platform\" focusing on containing all terror groups emanating from the region and ensure its peace and stability.
