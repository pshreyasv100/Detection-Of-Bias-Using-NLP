Washington Post,America,New Delhi,"As Donald Trump Jr. Drums Up Business in India, Some Ask Whatâ€™s Being Sold","Donald Trump Jr., who has spent the week in India pitching new luxury high-rises that bear his familyâ€™s name, took the stage before a crowd of about 200 on Thursday. â€œBuilding a Better Mumbai,â€ the banner behind him proclaimed.

â€œWeâ€™re actually delivering true luxury,â€ Mr. Trump told the guests, who were greeted by a red carpet, lit candles and a jazz band. â€œWeâ€™re actually delivering buildings in the Indian marketplace that you can take out of that marketplace, put in any cosmopolitan of the world and say, â€˜This is on par with some of the best.â€™â€

The Trump Organization is reaping the windfall from Indiaâ€™s admiration for President Trump. He may have low approval ratings at home, but he appears well liked in a country with one of the fastest-growing populations of millionaires in the world.

The Trump brand â€œspells glamour more than luxury,â€ said Kalyani Chawla, a brand consultant and former executive at Christian Dior in India who attended the event. â€œI think itâ€™s all about Donald Trump, honestly,â€ she said, â€œany idea of Donald Trump in general, regardless of the fact that even heâ€™s surprised heâ€™s the president of the United States.â€

But even before the presidentâ€™s son arrived in India to press the flesh and do the deals, his trip was creating controversy over its potential for blurring the lines between the Trump White House and the Trump Organization.
As Mr. Trump hopped from city to city, Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, sought assurances from the United States Embassy in Delhi that it was not helping Mr. Trump. And ethics experts seemed unable to overstate the incongruity of a sitting presidentâ€™s son drumming up business overseas.
â€œNothing like this â€” no, never,â€ said Marilyn L. Glynn, who served as general counsel at the Office of Government Ethics during parts of the Clinton and Bush administrations. â€œUnprecedented, unheard-of.â€
The controversy only grew as word spread that Mr. Trump planned to give a speech in New Delhi on Friday, taking the podium before Prime Minister Narendra Modi speaks. The topic: â€œReshaping Indo-Pacific Ties: The New Era of Cooperation.â€
â€œThe title sure sounds like something you would hear from a diplomat,â€ said Joshua White, who worked in the Obama White House as director for South Asian Affairs at the National Security Council. â€œIt is not illegal, but it would muddy the waters and I think make life rather difficult for those in the United States government who are being measured about how they articulate what the administrationâ€™s Indo-Pacific strategy is and will become.â€
On Wednesday, Mr. Menendez said in a letter to the embassy in New Delhi, â€œGiven the potential to confuse Mr. Trumpâ€™s private business visit with having an official governmental purpose, I write to ensure that the U.S. Embassy presence in India will have no role in supporting Mr. Trump or the Trump Organization during his time in India, other than that necessary to provide any security support for the U.S. Secret Service.â€

The embassy said it had no role in the visit other than helping with his security.

In his comments on the stage in Mumbai on Thursday, Mr. Trump defended his actions, and said his fatherâ€™s job had actually been bad for business.

â€œWe donâ€™t want any kind of conflict of interest,â€ he said. â€œWe donâ€™t want anyone to say that weâ€™re taking advantage. From a business perspective, itâ€™s clearly a negative. There will be a time after politics where we will be able to get back into that market.â€

After the talk was done, many in the audience excitedly rushed the stage to shake his hand before he disappeared.

If India loves the presidentâ€™s son, he appears to love it back.

â€œI think there is something about the spirit of the Indian people that is unique here to other parts of the emerging world,â€ Mr. Trump said in a local television interview earlier in the week. He said, â€œI donâ€™t want to be glib but you can see the poorest of the poor and there is still a smile on a face.â€

â€œI know some of the most successful people in the world and some of them are the most miserable people in the world,â€ he added.
Before speaking at the reception in Mumbai on Thursday evening, Mr. Trump made a renewed pitch for one of his companyâ€™s developments in the city, meeting with dozens of buyers in the tower overlooking the Arabian Sea.

After paying 80 million Indian rupees, or $1.2 million, for a three-bedroom apartment, Sumeet Arora, one of the buyers, expected the developer to be prompt for the meeting. Instead, they waited for an hour and a half for Mr. Trump to show up.

When he finally arrived at noon, Mr. Trump gave the well-heeled audience members a sales pitch on the virtues of the building, even though they had already collectively pledged millions of dollars on the units, which are to open by June 2019.

â€œTheyâ€™ve got some units left â€” they wanted us to suggest people as leads,â€ Mr. Arora said.

Under the Trump administration, New Delhi is enjoying some of the warmest relations it has ever had with Washington. For Indian officials, part of the appeal is the hard line the administration has taken on Pakistan, Indiaâ€™s chief rival. But for many other Indians, it is simply that the Trump family name seems to them to be synonymous with success.

In New Delhi over the weekend, several of the countryâ€™s leading newspapers carried full front-page ads with the younger Mr. Trumpâ€™s face, arms crossed over his chest with the question: â€œTrump is here. Are you invited?â€

The ad promised a meeting with the presidentâ€™s son if prospective buyers put down a booking fee of about $38,000 for a Trump Organization project in Gurgaon, just south of New Delhi.

The promise of a meeting with the younger Mr. Trump was apparently enough to spur sales, said Kalpesh Mehta of Tribeca Developers, the Trump Organizationâ€™s partner for the Gurgaon project. Mr. Mehta told local reporters that on Monday alone, when Mr. Trump touched down in New Delhi to kick off his weeklong tour, the company recorded sales of $15 million. Ground has yet to be broken on the two Trump towers in Gurgaon â€” the completion date is in 2023 â€” but sales have topped $100 million, Mr. Mehta said.

Mumbai is the financial center of the country and has one of the largest concentrations of billionaires in the world. It also has some of its biggest slums. In the city, formerly known as Bombay, construction cranes and half-finished buildings dot the skyline. New towers compete with old ones, as buildings go ever higher to maximize space and provide better views of the Arabian Sea and the city below.
â€œBombay all of a sudden has gone vertical,â€ said Mr. Arora, whose current home in a 10-story building in Mumbaiâ€™s Juhu neighborhood has slowly been dwarfed by taller buildings.
Ms. Chawla, the brand consultant who attended the candlelit reception, said she admired the Trump properties she has seen abroad. But there is a world of difference between admiring and owning.
â€œI wish I could afford it,â€ she said. â€œI feel really inadequate sometimes when I come to these things.â€

The New York Times,America,,India-U.S. Relations: The Search for a Transformative Moment,"India and the world have changed dramatically in the past two decades. The relationship between India and the United States has strengthened spectacularly and brought substantive gain to both countries. It has also given birth to great expectations. The management and fulfilment of those expectations is crucial for the dialogue and partnership between the two countries.

The India-U.S. Strategic Dialogue 2013 comes at a critical moment. India is increasingly focused on the forthcoming national elections. President Barack Obama, in his second term, is looking at the legacy he would bequeath to his country and the world.

The relationship between India and the United States has been driven by both the bilateral governmental interface and the natural affinity and attraction between their citizens. The liberal philosophical moorings of some of the first leaders of independent India, shared values of democracy and freedom, and admiration for the American Constitution, brought us together. A growing number of Indian students and professionals sought educational and work opportunities in the United States alongside Indiaâ€™s engagement with the Non-Aligned Movement and the Soviet Union.

The intrinsic bond between two liberal democracies was captured in the iconic photograph of President John F. Kennedy and Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru by the Potomac in Washington. And the subsequent distances in our relationship were evoked well by a photo characterized by the stiff body language of President Richard M. Nixon and Prime Minister Indira Gandhi years later.

From â€œestranged democraciesâ€ to â€œengaged democracies,â€ it has been a long and fascinating journey for India and the United States. India is exploring and absorbing in myriad ways its transition from being a country subjected to select American sanctions to becoming a strategic partner of the United States.

In the Indian discovery of America and the American discovery of India, increased expectations, timely delivery on commitments, agreed-upon mutual course corrections and consolidation of gains would be crucial.

India-U.S. Strategic Dialogue provides opportunities to measure the distance traveled and to map the future. The elements of contemporary international relations are complex. Strands of real or perceived ideology and self-interest intertwine to shape and shade the global fabric. The United States has fought valiantly in Afghanistan and India will willingly make its contribution to the peace and rehabilitation effort in its own characteristic and calibrated manner. Peace is indivisible and must come as a whole, not in pieces, both in our neighborhood and beyond. There is much scope for joint reflection on these matters.

Attempts to create a better world are as challenging as resolving conflicts. Sustainable development and climate change, an equitable and efficient world trade system, food and energy security, cyber security and counter-terrorism strategies are all matters on which there are differing and divided opinions across the globe. The G8 and G20 nations have yet to bridge the gaps in perception and strategies of the developing and the developed countries even as the emerging economies attempt to straddle the two sides.

It makes it imperative for the India-U.S. Strategic Dialogue to succeed in the interest of our two countries and the world. In the lives of nations, as in the lives of people, the right moment can achieve what years of effort strove for. India and the United States found that transformative moment in the signing of the Civil Nuclear Agreement. We need to build upon that success and work towards the next defining moment.

Every nation seeks partners and friends. India and the United States are no exception, but we are currently tasked to nurture the strategic partnership that we already have in place and to which we are mutually committed to preserve and protect. The pressures and difficulties posed by our domestic politics and economics, the unresolved issues of the world, must not deter us.

The challenge before us is to reconcile competing self-interests and combine them into enlightened mutual interest. That is not a simple matter of persuasive arguments and attractive power point presentations. We both have constraints of democracy, which are exacerbated by the different levels of development and corresponding demands of our respective economies, societies and people.

For instance, India at the moment is relatively low on carbon emissions. But those will increase as we address the developmental needs of our people, unless adequately provided to adapt to low-emission technology that is obviously costly.

Developing countries like India expect that the United States and other developed countries will agree to binding targets to cut emissions, having had the advantage of several centuries of development. This competing logic applies to many sectors. The solutions lie in our mutual convergence at a middle ground. The very purpose of dialogue is to find common ground and to creatively conceive a point of agreement where there is none. It is important that ours is a dialogue that flows from our partnership and not one to create a relationship.

India is not impervious to the pressures the United States faces as it walks the fiscal cliff, tries to revive its economy, addresses persisting unemployment, and the inevitable demands from its businessmen and people that the US government pursue policies for preferential domestic production and services to protect jobs.

Many of our own aspirations are linked with increased demand for goods and services in the United States. India expects her friends in the West to understand how tough a current account deficit can be on a developing economy, how important it is that information technology and pharmaceuticalsâ€”the sectors of our economy that have provided the cutting edge to Indiaâ€™s growth and boosted our middle class â€” be supported and encouraged. In India today, social activists and the courts are vigorously scrutinizing public servants, which impacts response time. There is a steep learning curve as we take the reform road. Our fiercely autonomous Parliament and judiciary, reflecting the separation of powers, have to be taken on board to ensure a satisfactory response to our collective aspirations. This will be speeded up with important conceptual strides that we hope to take soon.

Secretary of State John Kerry will be received in India as a familiar name and face, having been a key figure in U.S. foreign policy as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee during a period of great significance to India. It will be an opportunity for him to reconnect with several old friends and discover new ones. It will indeed be an honor for me to sit across the table from him at Hyderabad House and draw plans for taking our relationship forward, both between the two of us as indeed for our countries.

As we look from Raisina Hill to Capitol Hill, we can see President Obama and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh wrapping up a decade of eventful cooperation later this year. That provides us with an impetus to further the spirit of working together that was underscored by the historic Indian-U.S. Civil Nuclear Agreement and the contemporaneous paradigm shift in perceptions.

The road ahead is the very road that was signposted by milestones such as the meeting of my predecessor, Foreign Minister S. M. Krishna with Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton. The signposts of strategic partnership will hopefully have sectors such as clean energy, innovation in science and technology, peaceful use of nuclear energy, space, education and skills development, securing global supply chains, interdict illicit finance flows and counterfeit currency, intelligence sharing, enhanced cyber security, and the expansion of trade and investment.

Finally in the realm of defense, we hope our relationship is not merely a buyer-seller relationship, but a true strategic partnership involving joint research, manufacture of equipment, training of personnel and military exercises.

The building blocks of such a partnership are in place, but they need to be cemented by sustained and enhanced political will. We are able to talk and listen even where convergent and common positions take time to formulate.

Long journeys require pauses. We might pause and rest, but we arenâ€™t reluctant travelers. Traffic rules in our respective countries might mandate us to drive on different sides of the road, the spirit of the July 2005 joint statement and November 2010 joint statement of Prime Minister Singh and President Obama has brought us on a shared path and agreed destination. We need to watch the speed, not lose time, and yet not be reckless.

Secretary Kerry and I wonâ€™t only judge how the engines are running, but also reaffirm how the spirit of adventure remains undiminished. As we drive past the fields of opportunity, I paraphrase the lines of the great American poet Robert Frost that Prime Minister Nehru loved to quote: â€œThe woods are lovely, dark and deep, but I have promises to keep; And miles to go before I sleep; And miles to go before I sleep.â€ The dialogue between India and the United States will be an objective look at the miles ahead but also a reaffirmation of our strategic partnership.

India's PM Wants Deeper Security Relationship With U.S.","Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for a closer security relationship between his country and the United States on Wednesday, in an address to the U.S. Congress stressing the importance of warming ties between the two countries.

He dedicated much of the speech to the importance of fighting terrorism, thanking Congress for U.S. support after a Pakistan-based military group's rampage in Mumbai killed 166 people in 2008.

""The fight against terrorism has to be fought at many levels. And the traditional tools of military, intelligence or diplomacy alone would not be able to win this fight,"" Modi told a rare joint meeting of the Senate and House of Representatives.


""We have both lost civilians and soldiers in combating it. The need of the hour is for us to deepen our security cooperation,"" Modi said.

He leavened the speech to lawmakers, the first such address by an international leader since Pope Francis' in September, with jokes about Congress' bitter partisan divide and yoga. But Modi used it to make serious points about India's neighbor and arch-rival Pakistan and regional concerns about Chinese expansionism.


""I commend the members of the U.S. Congress for sending a clear message to those who preach and practice terrorism for political gains,"" he said, not mentioning either country by name.

Modi is on the U.S. leg of an international tour. On Tuesday, he met with President Barack Obama at the White House, where the two leaders said India agreed to work toward joining the Paris Agreement on climate change this year and discussed security and cybersecurity issues.

In a speech interrupted by cheers and at least eight standing ovations, Modi said deeper U.S.-Indian security cooperation should isolate anyone who harbors, supports or sponsors terrorists.

Although he did not mention Pakistan, that line was greeted with applause from the U.S. lawmakers, many of whom are increasingly frustrated with what they see as Islamabad's failure to crack down on militants behind attacks on American troops in Afghanistan.

Modi also stressed that India is committed to helping rebuild a peaceful and stable Afghanistan, even as he said he considers terrorism the biggest threat there and elsewhere in South Asia.

At a time of heightened regional tensions over China's assertive pursuit of territory in the South China Sea, Modi said a stronger U.S.-India partnership could boost peace and prosperity ""from Asia to Africa and from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific."" He did not mention China.

""It can also help ensure security of the sea lanes and commerce and freedom of navigation on seas,"" Modi added.

Democrats leaped to their feet when Modi referred to the recent climate change summit, in a discussion of the importance of renewable energy. But Republicans in the House chamber remained seated, reflecting the U.S. political divide over the issue.

House Speaker Paul Ryan greeted Modi at his office before his speech. After the Indian leader's remarks, he attended lunch with congressional leaders and a reception with members of the House Foreign Affairs and Senate Foreign Relations committees.

NBC News,America,"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan ",Can Departure of Strip-Search Diplomat Save US-India Relations?,"The late-night departure of a diplomat who was indicted for lying about how much she paid her housekeeper might be enough to resolve the spat between the United States and India, observers said Friday.

India remains angry at the treatment of Devyani Khobragade, who was handcuffed and strip-searched in New York after being arrested on allegations she provided bogus information on her housekeeperâ€™s visa application for entry into the U.S.

â€œNo American diplomat would have been treated like that in India,â€ said Suhasini Haidar, host of a popular Indian cable television news show.

Khobragade was flying home Friday after a deal in which she was indicted but allowed to leave after being granted full diplomatic immunity. It means she cannot return to the U.S. - except in her diplomatic role as a member of the Indian mission to the United Nations â€“ or she will face charges.

However, will that be enough to rebuild ties between Washington and New Delhi?

Khobragade â€˜s case has caused outrage in India, where U.S. diplomats had their ID cards revoked in retaliation, and has dominated the headlines as the country prepares for an election. Her arrest, outside her daughterâ€™s school, was denounced by the Indian government as ""barbaric.""

India retaliated once again Friday, asking the United States to withdraw a diplomat from its embassy in New Delhi. But few in India see any permanent damage in ties.

â€œPragmatism kicked in,â€ said Nilim Dutta, executive director of the Strategic Research and Analysis Organization think tank in New Delhi. â€œIt always happens when so much is at stake for such important countries. Some amount of posturing happened on both sides, but nations are not run on emotions alone. I donâ€™t see this playing out for very long. â€œ

Thursdayâ€™s 20-page indictment by U.S. prosecutors accuses Khobragade of creating a fake employment contract for her housekeeper and nanny Sangeet Richard that claimed she would be paid $9.75 an hour for 40 hours of work a week.

In reality, the grand jury found, Khobragade had negotiated a secret deal with the maid to pay her just $3.33 an hour and ended up paying her less than $2 an hour by making her work 90-plus hours a week with no days off, including sick time.

However, the manner of her arrest still angers many Indians. â€œShe wasnâ€™t treated like a diplomat,â€ said the TV host Haidar. â€œThat triggered off a lot of outrage. The fact that she was an Indian woman, a mother, who was handcuffed and brought into court, after she was strip searched and thrown into a cell with drug dealers and prostitutes for a non-lethal crime, really broke things down.

â€œYou cannot treat her as an ordinary person, because sheâ€™s not one.â€

She added that the bitterness felt in India can be explained by a â€œcultural disconnectâ€ between the two nations. â€œIn India, the case was about the mistreated diplomat. In America, it was about the underpaid maid.â€

This case had a dimension that went beyond foreign policy for both sides, Haider said. â€œOn a personal level, it was hurtful for diplomats from both sides. Thatâ€™s unique. When countries face off, their government-to-government ties are affected, but not personal ties. This was personal.â€

Allowing Khobragade to return to India was a move that put diplomacy ahead of the law, said Dutta.

â€œCool heads prevailed in the U.S., and much of it was thanks to John Kerry who was, unfortunately, traveling when this breakdown happened initially. The Americans have realized that they canâ€™t just go legal here, they canâ€™t keep on defining this issue based on strict legal interpretations,"" said Dutta. ""They had to be more nuance, more diplomatic.â€

Dutta said Indiaâ€™s recent purchase of 12 Boeing Poseidon military jets was a sign that Washington and New Delhi have â€œa special relationship.â€

â€œThis was a minor matter, at the end of the day,â€ said Dutta. â€œIt doesnâ€™t fit in the larger U.S.-Indian interest. If you look back, itâ€™s amazing how these two, great countries were fighting over a housekeeper.â€"
NBC News,America,"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan ","Pakistan frees Hafiz Saeed, alleged mastermind of Mumbai attacks","Pakistani authorities released the alleged mastermind of the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks from house arrest, but he still has a $10 million U.S. bounty on his head.

Hafiz Saeed, whose arrest in January was seen as a signal of a broader shift in Pakistanâ€™s treatment of extremists, was freed before dawn Friday local time in the city of Lahore, according to Hafiz Abdul Rauf, a spokesman for the Islamist cleric's charity.

""Iâ€™m happy that no allegation against me was proved, which could have done damage to me, or my countryâ€™s interests,"" Saeed later told supporters. ""Thank God, we were vindicated.""

Saeed ran the Jamaat-Ud-Dawa organization (Party of the Faith), which is thought to be a front for the Lashkar-e-Tayyaba militant group. India believes that Lashkar-e-Tayyaba was behind the deadly attack in Mumbai.

Pakistan has been detaining and freeing Saeed off and on since the attacks left 166 dead, including several Americans.

His release came after a panel of judges dismissed a government request to continue his house arrest, which ended Thursday. Four aides had already been released.

The government's decision to place Saeed under house arrest in January was driven in part by President Donald Trumpâ€™s arrival on the world stage as well as pressure from China, according to military insiders, and his release prompted a sharply worded statement from the State Department.

The United States is ""deeply concerned"" about Saeed's release, given that Lashkar-e-Tayyaba is ""responsible for the death of hundreds of innocent civilians in terrorist attacks, including a number of American citizens,"" the statement said. ""The Pakistani government should make sure that he is arrested and charged for his crimes.""

India's External Affairs Ministry also condemned the release, and said in a statement that a ""self-confessed and U.N. proscribed terrorist was being allowed to walk free and continue with his evil agenda.""

""He was not only the mastermind, he was the prime organizer of the Mumbai terror attacks in which many innocent Indians and many people from other nationalities were killed,"" spokesman Raveesh Kumar said in a statement.

Kumar said Saeed's ""release confirms once again the lack of seriousness on the part of Pakistani government in bringing to justice perpetrators of heinous acts of terrorism.""

Like much of Pakistan's establishment, Saeed was virulently anti-India and campaigned against New Delhiâ€™s occupation of the disputed territory of Kashmir for years.

Often a guest on conservative television talks shows, the popular jihadist still attracts large crowds with his anti-American and anti-Indian diatribes in rallies and protests.

Even though Pakistan has been involved in extensive counterterror and counterinsurgency operations against al Qaeda, the Pakistani Taliban and the Islamic State â€” the military says it has lost more than 7,000 soldiers battling terrorists since Sept. 11, 2001 â€” it is often blamed for selectively harboring certain other militant groups.

These include elements of the deadly Haqqani network in Afghanistan, the leadership of the Afghan Taliban, as well as Lashkar-e-Tayyaba.

Saeed's release could once again sour U.S. relations with nuclear-armed Islamabad, which had seen an apparent improvement in relations after the rescue by Pakistanâ€™s military of the American hostage Caitlan Coleman and her family on Oct. 13.

""This is a positive moment for our country's relationship with Pakistan,"" Trump said in a statement after Coleman was freed. ""The Pakistani government's cooperation is a sign that it is honoring America's wishes for it to do more to provide security in the region.""

Ties between Islamabad and Washington had deteriorated during Trumpâ€™s first months in office.

In August, he warned that Pakistan had â€œmuch to loseâ€ if it failed to cooperate with the U.S. in neighboring Afghanistan. He also expressed a desire to see India â€” Pakistanâ€™s archrival â€” become an active stakeholder in stabilizing Afghanistan.

Before becoming president, Trump criticized Pakistan and said in a tweet: ""Get it straight: Pakistan is not our friend. Weâ€™ve given them billions and billions of dollars, and what did we get? Betrayal and disrespectâ€”and much worse. #TimeToGetTough""

For years, the Pakistanis have been blamed by the U.S. for not doing enough in their counterterrorism efforts to end the Afghan war â€” the longest military engagement in America's history. Islamabad has rejected the criticism, saying it has also suffered being an ally of Washington in the war against terror.

NBC News,America,New Delhi,"Arrest, search of female diplomat in NYC 'despicable and barbaric,' Indian official says","The arrest and alleged strip search of an Indian diplomat in New York City escalated into a major diplomatic furor Tuesday as India's national security adviser called the woman's treatment ""despicable and barbaric."" 
Devyani Khobragade, India's deputy consul general in New York, is accused of submitting false documents to obtain a work visa for her Manhattan housekeeper. Indian officials said she was arrested and handcuffed Thursday as she dropped off her daughter at school, and was kept in a cell with drug addicts before posting $250,000 bail. 
A senior Indian official confirmed reports that she also was strip-searched, which has been portrayed in India as the most offensive and troubling part of the arrest. The official spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case. 
Her U.S. attorney said he didn't know if she was strip-searched. Federal authorities said they were looking into the arrest. 
""We understand that this is a sensitive issue for many in India,"" said Marie Harf, State Department deputy spokeswoman. ""Accordingly, we are looking into the intake procedures surrounding this arrest to ensure that all appropriate procedures were followed and every opportunity for courtesy was extended."" 
Harf said that federal authorities would work on the issue with India ""in the spirit of partnership and cooperation that marks our broad bilateral relationship."" 
India was ready to retaliate against American diplomats in India by threatening to downgrade privileges and demanding information about how much they pay their Indian household staff, according to the Press Trust of India news agency. 
Police also removed the traffic barricades near the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi, a demand by the Indian government in retaliation for Khobragade's treatment, PTI reported. The barriers were a safety measure. 
""We got orders to remove the concrete barriers,"" said Amardeep Sehgal, station house officer of the Chanakyapuri police station, the one nearest the embassy. ""They were obstructing traffic on the road."" He refused to say who had given the orders. 
Calls to the U.S. Embassy were not immediately returned Tuesday. 
National Security Adviser Shivshankar Menon slammed Khobragade's treatment in New York. 
""It is despicable and barbaric,"" he said. 
Prosecutors in New York say Khobragade, 39, claimed she paid her Indian maid $4,500 per month but actually paid her less than the U.S. minimum wage. In order for diplomats and consular officers to get a visa for their personal employees, known as an A-3 visa, they must show proof that the applicant will receive a fair wage, comparable to employment in the U.S., U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement last week. 
Federal prosecutors say Khobragade told the housekeeper she would be paid 30,000 rupees per month â€” about $573, or $3.31 per hour. The woman worked for the family from about November 2012 through June 2013, and said she worked far more than 40 hours per week and was paid even less than 30,000 rupees, prosecutors said. 
Khobragade has pleaded not guilty and plans to challenge the arrest on grounds of diplomatic immunity, her lawyer said last week. 
If convicted, Khobragade faces a maximum sentence of 10 years for visa fraud and five years for making a false declaration. She was arrested outside of her daughter's Manhattan school. 
""We are distressed at the treatment that Dr. Khobragade has received at the hands of U.S. authorities,"" said her lawyer, Daniel Arshack, he said she should have diplomatic immunity. 
Her case quickly became a major story in India, with politicians urging diplomatic retaliation and TV news channels showing the woman in a series of smiling family photos. 
That reaction may look outsized in the United States, but the case touches on a string of issues that strike deeply in India, where the fear of public humiliation resonates strongly and heavy-handed treatment by the police is normally reserved for the poor. For an educated, middle-class woman to face public arrest and a strip search is almost unimaginable, except in the most brutal crimes. 
Far less serious protocol complaints have become big issues in the past. Standard security checks in the U.S. regularly are front-page news here when they involve visiting Indian dignitaries, who are largely exempt from friskings while at home. 
India's former speaker of Parliament, Somnath Chatterjee, once refused to attend an international meeting in Australia when he wasn't given a guarantee that he would not have to pass through security. Chatterjee said even the possibility of a security screening was ""an affront to India."" 
The treatment and pay of household staff, meanwhile, is largely seen as a family issue, off-limits to the law. 
The fallout from the arrest was growing. On Tuesday, Indian political leaders from both the ruling party and the opposition refused to meet with the U.S. congressional delegation in New Delhi. The Indian government said it was ""shocked and appalled at the manner in which the diplomat had been humiliated"" in the U.S. 
Indian Foreign Secretary Sujata Singh summoned U.S. Ambassador Nancy Powell to register a complaint. 
In Washington, U.S. State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf said Tuesday that the department's diplomatic security team followed standard procedures during the arrest. After her arrest, Khobragade was handed over to U.S. marshals for intake and processing, she said. 
Harf also noted that there is diplomatic immunity and consular immunity. Under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, the Indian deputy consul general enjoys immunity from the jurisdiction of U.S. courts only with respect to acts performed in the exercise of consular functions, she said. 
Khobragade's father, Uttam Khobragade, told the TimesNow TV news channel on Tuesday that his daughter's treatment was ""absolutely obnoxious."" 
""As a father I feel hurt, our entire family is traumatized,"" he said. 
Indian External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid said there were ""larger issues"" involved in the case, but did not elaborate. 
""We will deal with them in good time,"" he said.

NBC News,America,,"Money, guns and democracy: Why the Obama administration is obsessed with India","Joe Biden arrives there on Monday, John Kerry declared it his â€œsecond homeâ€ on his trip last month, and Barack Obama will host its leader in the fall: But why is India the subject of such a concerted American charm offensive?

The answer essentially boils down to money, military hardware and a shared love of freedom â€” to paraphrase the opinions of a number of experts.

Some believe the worldâ€™s two biggest democracies will ultimately â€œshape the destiny of the 21st century.â€

A senior Obama administration official said Friday that Biden would meet with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and other leading officials in New Delhi on Tuesday and then head to Mumbai on Wednesday to give a speech at the Bombay Stock Exchange and meet with business leaders.

However, there are a number of signs suggesting the relationship might be in trouble -- a situation Washington appears keen to resolve.

Here are five reasons why India is feeling the love from the United States:

1. A bastion of democracy

Obama said the relationship between India and the U.S. would be one of the â€œdefining partnershipsâ€ of the 21st century while visiting the country in 2010, praising its tradition of tolerance and its free market economy.

Ron Somers, president of the U.S.-India Business Council, went further.

â€œItâ€™s going to be these two democracies that shape the destiny of the 21st century,â€ he said. â€œThese are beacons of freedom and democracy on opposite sides of the planet and weâ€™ve got to stick together with our close friends and believe in these principles.â€

It was a partnership based on â€œdemocracyâ€ and â€œa love, demand and insistence on freedom,â€ Somers added, while stressing these were not reasons to not trade with China.

Jody Venkatesan, national political director for the Republican Indian Committee in the U.S., said Indiaâ€™s importance had been recognized by George W. Bush during his time in office.

â€œThe Bush administration made great overtures to the Indian-American community and toward India in general,â€ he said.  â€œI think India has a strategic importance in terms of economic and intelligence purposes and freedom around the world.â€


He said he felt relations between ordinary Indian and American people were also in a good place. â€œThe Indian-American community has never betrayed the trust of the American public â€” and thatâ€™s huge,â€ he said.

But some in India believe American commitment to democratic values is not quite as strong as it should be.

Brahma Chellaney, a former adviser to Indiaâ€™s National Security Council, said India was concerned that the U.S. used its promotion of democracy as a political tool in some parts of the world â€œwhile staying quiet on China.â€

â€œThe Americans donâ€™t speak about Tibet at all and donâ€™t speak much about human rightsâ€ in China, he said by phone from New Delhi.

2. Booming economy

Indiaâ€™s economy has been growing at rates that rival the boom in China.

According to the World Bank, Indiaâ€™s gross domestic product rose from $1.2 trillion in 2008 to more than $1.8 trillion in 2012 â€“ a rise of 50 percent during a time when much of the world was going through the worst economic hardship for decades.

â€œEurope, unfortunately, is flat on its back economically and China is also having challenges with their economy,â€ said Somers, of the U.S.-India Business Council. â€œThe United States and India need to be developing a greater economic partnership now more than ever.â€

The amount of two-way trade between India and the United States has quadrupled in just seven years -- from $25 billion in 2006 to about $100 billion in 2013, he said.

A senior Obama administration official said there was â€œno reasonâ€ that the current level of trade between the two countries could not be â€œfive times as much.â€ Biden plans to raise issues about U.S. investment during his visit.

Ten years ago, defense trade between the two countries was worth just $100 million. Somers said this had since risen to $10 billion and stressed India had billions more to spend on defense, particularly as it seeks to expand its navy.

â€œIn the recent floods in Uttarakhand, those were [U.S.-made] C-17 and C-130J aircraft that were helping bring in medical supplies and helping rescue people,â€ he said.

The Indo-U.S. nuclear agreement of 2008 saw the United States agree ""to enable full civil nuclear energy cooperation"" with India, effectively ending India's isolation as a nuclear state following its nuclear bomb test in 1974.

Achin Vanaik, a professor at the political science department of Delhi University, said the deal was hugely important to India, but suggested its government's later decision to spend about $20 billion on French fighter jets, rather than American ones, was a disappointment to Washington.

""The Americans thought after the U.S. nuclear deal the Indians would buy their fighter planes, but it ended up with the Indians buying from the French -- that's a huge thing,"" he said. ""It obviously annoyed the Americans to some extent. They expected certain pay-offs.""

Somers, who was closely involved in the nuclear deal, strongly denied any suggestion of a ""quid pro quo"" on arms sales.

However, he admitted there were other tensions, saying U.S. businesses had concerns about enforcement of intellectual property rights in India and also about regional differences about how taxes are applied.

And U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman has also expressed concern about efforts to stimulate the economy by forcing Indian companies to buy home-produced goods.

3. A key ally in the war on terror

India has become a close ally of the United States in the fight against Islamist militants after suffering its own terrorist attacks.

Three months after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, Indiaâ€™s parliament in New Delhi was stormed by five men armed with guns, grenades and other explosives. Ten people died before the attackers were killed.

And in 2008, 166 people were killed when gunmen attacked a Jewish center and two five-star hotels in Mumbai. India has blamed the attack on Pakistan-based militants.

But recently the relationship has hit a rocky patch over the prospect of a U.S. peace deal with the Taliban in Afghanistan, something India fears would give its arch-rival Pakistan greater power in the region.

Chellaney, the former adviser to Indiaâ€™s National Security Council who now professor of strategic studies at the Centre for Policy Research in New Delhi, said that India was â€œgreatly troubledâ€ by talk of a deal and believed the â€œpolitical rehabilitation of the Taliban will be very injurious to regional security.â€

â€œThe Indians remain very concerned about the U.S. exit strategy, especially because these talks with the Taliban â€¦ are being conducted with the widespread support of the Pakistan army chief,â€ he said.

Any deal that saw the Taliban regain some political power would benefit Indiaâ€™s arch-rival Pakistan, giving them â€œa greater say in the future of Afghanistan,â€ Chellaney said.

India does not have troops in Afghanistan, though the idea they could replace Western forces after the 2014 pullout has been raised recently.

India has been a major supplier of aid to Afghanistan, spending a total of more than $750 million between 2002 and 2009. Afghan President Hamid Karzai met Indian Prime Minister Singh in May to discuss supplies of military equipment.

A senior Obama administration official said co-operation with India on â€œmaritime securityâ€ and â€œcounter terrorismâ€ would be one of the issues at the top of the agenda. He spoke of a â€œstrategic convergenceâ€ between India and the U.S.

Asked about Indian concern over talks with the Taliban, the official stressed the United Statesâ€™ view that the militant movement would have â€œto be breaking with al Qaeda, renouncing violence and abiding by the terms of the Afghan constitutionâ€ to be part of an Afghan-led peace process.

4. A counterweight to China

India and the United States are the worldâ€™s two biggest democracies, but the worldâ€™s most populous country is China.

And is its economy has surged, it has begun to flex its muscles, pursuing territorial disputes with many of its neighbors.

India and China fought a war in 1962 and in April and May this year there was a three-week standoff after Chinese troops â€œintruded in Indian territory,â€ according to Indian officials.

Award-winning historian Margaret MacMillan â€” author of both â€œNixon and Mao,â€ about the two leadersâ€™ famous 1972 meeting, and â€œWomen of the Raj,â€ about India during British rule â€” said she thought U.S.-Chinese relations had â€œproved to be disappointing for the Obama administration.â€

The extended diplomatic push aimed at New Delhi might be a way of sending a message to Beijing, she said.

â€œIt suggests to me the great Asian pivot with improved relations with China has turned out to be a bit of a bust,â€ said MacMillan, who is a professor at St. Anthonyâ€™s College, Oxford University.

However, she said the U.S. would probably try to avoid picking a side and stay in the middle.

â€œItâ€™s a tricky game, but if you can be the power at the center and tilt to one side and the other, it actually gives you a lot of influence,â€ she said.

5. Biden might have some explaining to do

The somewhat gaffe-prone Biden declared in 2006 that â€œYou cannot go to a 7-11 or a Dunkin Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent ... I'm not joking.â€

Bidenâ€™s staff later clarified he was praising the â€œvibrantâ€ Indian-American community in Delaware, and making the point that along with engineers, scientists and physicians, there was a growing number of more middle-class people.

And then last year, he made headlines when he briefly appeared to imitate an Indian accent while talking about American job losses and overseas call centers last year.

Chellaney said Bidenâ€™s attempt at mimicry had been â€œfront-page newsâ€ in India, but doubted it would cause any problems on his trip.

â€œThe public memory in India is really short. Most people will have forgotten these incidents. I think he will be warmly received in India,â€ he said.

And Somers insisted Biden was â€œone of the best friends of India that has ever come from the United States,â€ noting his championing of the Indo-U.S. nuclear agreement.

And The Times of India was reasonably relaxed about Bidenâ€™s apparent mimicry, noting his â€œpenchant for bloopersâ€ and saying it was â€œmildâ€ by his usual standards.

NBC News,America,,Judge Dismisses Charges Against Indian Diplomat,"A federal judge has dismissed charges against an Indian deputy consul-general whose New York City arrest and strip-search set off a diplomatic spat that strained relations between the United States and India.

A ruling filed Wednesday concluded that Devyani Khobragade had diplomatic immunity â€” and therefore could not be prosecuted â€” when she was charged in December with submitting false documents to get a work visa for her Manhattan housekeeper and making false statements about that housekeeper's compensation.

Prosecutors had alleged that Khobragade paid the maid, an Indian national, around $3 per hour.

After being indicted, Khobragade followed a State Department order to leave the country. The Indian government, in turn, then asked Washington to remove a diplomat from the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi. The State Department complied â€” but tensions flared.

The ruling Wednesday by Judge Shira Scheindlin, however, doesn't close the door on a new indictment against Khobragade.

The prosecution is able to pursue a new indictment now or in the future since Khobragade no longer possesses diplomatic status or immunity, the ruling said.

Daniel Arshack, Khobragade's lawyer, said he and his client ""are heartened that the court agreed with our legal analysis and rejected the prosecution's arguments by dismissing the case.""

Although prosecutors are free to re-indict her, ""the decision to do so might well be viewed as an aggressive and unnecessary act,"" according to Arshack.

""This current circumstance might well present the best opportunity for a lasting and final diplomatic resolution,"" he added.

But a statement from the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan seemed to suggest that they would indeed seek a new indictment.

""As the court indicated in its decision, and as Devyani Khobragade has conceded, there is currently no bar to a new indictment against her for her alleged criminal conduct, and we intend to proceed accordingly,"" James Margolin, a spokesman for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan, told the AP."
NBC News,America,,Obama Nominates Richard Verma as Next Ambassador to India,"President Obama said this week that he would be nominating former State Department official Richard Rahul Verma to become the next Ambassador to India.

Vermaâ€™s nomination was one of seven others announced by Obama to fill open administration posts.

â€œI am grateful that these impressive individuals have chosen to dedicate their talents to serving the American people at this important time for our country,â€ Obama said in a statement.

If confirmed by Congress, Verma would become the first-ever Indian-American Ambassador to India. His nomination also comes after a year of strained relations between the United States and India, following the arrest of India's former Deputy Consul in New York, Devyani Khobragade. Her arrest, for charges of visa fraud related to her housekeeper's wages, outraged many Indians, who called Khobragade's treatment ""despicable"" and ""barbaric.""

Then-Ambassador Nancy Powell resigned in the aftermath in March 2014.

Verma, a former Washington, D.C. lawyer and assistant secretary of state for legislative affairs during Obama's first term, is also an Air Force veteran who served on active duty between 1994 and 1998.

His nomination comes just before the first American visit by newly elected Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who will arrive in New York later this month.

NBC News,America,New Delhi,Donald Trump Jr. praises 'spirit' of India's people during promotional trip,"Poverty-stricken people in India could teach some of the world's richest a lesson, Donald Trump Jr. said during a visit to the country to help sell luxury apartments featuring his familyâ€™s name.

â€œI don't want to be glib but you can see the poorest of the poor and there is still a smile on a face,"" the president's eldest son said in an interview with CNBC TV18. ""It is a different spirit than that which you see in other parts of the world and I think there is something unique about that.""

Trump Jr. added, â€œI know some of the most successful businessmen in the world, and some of them are the most miserable people in the world.â€
Donald Trump Jr. says India's poorest have something special


As part of his trip, Trump Jr. is due to meet with Indians who have already bought units in Trump-branded developments.

A barrage of glossy full-page advertisements in Indian newspapers promised that buyers who order apartments in that development by Thursday will get ""a conversation and dinner"" with Trump Jr. one day later.

""Trump has arrived. Have you?"" read the front-page ads in almost every major Indian newspaper.

The apartments are expensive â€” though not outrageously so in the overheated real estate world of India's wealthy elite. An apartment in the Trump Towers complex in the New Delhi suburb of Gurgaon runs $775,000 to $1.5 million.


The average person in the territory of Delhi now earns around $4,600 annually, The Times of India reported last year. That figure was around three times the national average.

On Friday, Trump Jr. is scheduled to make a speech about Indo-Pacific relations at a New Delhi business summit. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to speak at the same event later in the day.

After his father became president, Trump Jr. took over the running of the Trump businesses together with his brother Eric.

Unlike his sister Ivanka Trump, Trump Jr. has no official role in his father's administration.

""There would be no shortage of business that we could do""

""There would be no shortage of business that we could do""

The Trump Organization has licensing agreements with all its Indian business partners, who build the properties and acquire the Trump name in exchange for a fee. The organization has five projects in India, making it the brand's largest market outside the United States.

The projects that Trump Jr. is promoting in India were inked before his father was elected. President Trump has pledged to avoid any new foreign business deals during his term in office to avoid potential ethical conflicts.

Trump Jr. expressed frustration at his inability to build the business in India while his father is in the White House.

""It is unfortunate we are not able to do new ones because there would be no shortage of business that we could do, but it is an understandable opportunity cost of some of the other things that we are doing that are also important,"" he said.
 

Ethics experts have long seen the use of the Trump name to promote even existing business ventures as tricky territory.

A luxury complex with the Trump name is already open in the central city of Pune, with other developments in varying stages of construction in the coastal cities of Mumbai and Kolkata, and two in chrome-and-glass in Gurgaon."
NBC News,America,,"Obamas welcome Singh, guests to state dinner","The first state dinner of the Obama White House had it all: Oscar-winning entertainers, Hollywood moguls, a knockout guest chef and even a wardrobe malfunction.

Traditional evening gowns vied with saris of vibrant colors Tuesday night at the high-glitz dinner in honor of Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. There were turbans and bindis as well as diamonds and brocades.

""Everyone looks great; we're feeling great,"" White House social secretary Desiree Rogers told a phalanx of cameramen as she arrived, betraying no hint of nerves at the biggest social event of the Obama presidency.

First lady Michelle Obama had been a little more forthcoming earlier in the day when she described the trick to pulling off the event as sort of like being a swan: calm and serene above the water but ""paddling like mad, going crazy underneath.""


Attorney General Eric Holder patted his pocket as he arrived and said his kids had prepped him with all sorts of questions for tablemate Steven Spielberg. U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice, asked who she was most looking forward to chatting with, ventured, ""I'd have to name four."" Then didn't.

Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania had to scramble when his ensemble went rogue at just the wrong moment: His cummerbund dropped to the floor just as he and his wife stopped to pose before a scrum of about 40 reporters and photographers.

Dinner guests were treated to an eye-catching scheme of green and purple, from the green curry surrounding the prawns to the purple floral arrangements paying homage to the peacock, India's national bird.

Pumpkin was on the menu, too, with Tuesday's dinner coming just two days before Thanksgiving.

Big-tent politics?
Hours before guests arrived and in keeping with tradition, Mrs. Obama previewed the glamorous table settings in the State Dining Room. That's often the venue for such dinners, but not this time.

Instead, in an effort to show Singh how much the U.S. values relations with his country, the Obamas decided to serve dinner in a huge white tent on the South Lawn, with views of the Washington Monument and Lincoln Memorial through clear panels.

It wasn't your everyday tent: This one had chandeliers suspended from the ceiling and beige carpet on the floor.

President Barack Obama, in his dinner toast, said the setting conjured images of India, where special events are ""often celebrated under the cover of a beautiful tent."" Singh, in turn, told the president he was overwhelmed by the Obamas' hospitality and said the president's election last year had been an inspiration to millions of Indians.

NBC News,America,"LAHORE, Pakistan",Legal Gridlock Grips Nuclear-Armed U.S. Ally Pakistan,"Pakistan is gridlocked with an array of senior officials and other elites in the Islamic republic facing criminal charges, including allegations of corruption and murder.

The legal woes besetting America's nuclear-armed ally come amid extremist threats, tensions between its civilian and military leaders, a mounting financial crisis and deteriorating relations with arch-rival India.

â€œIt is a fractured country where no one seems to be in control of the situation,â€ said Zahid Hussain, a longtime Pakistani columnist.

At the heart of the stalemate gripping the country are problems facing former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his family. The Supreme Court ousted him in July for not declaring his income.

Last week, Sharif set the stage for a political comeback with the passing of a bill in Parliament that would allow him to regain control of the Pakistan Muslim League â€” Nawaz, a right-of-center, pro-business party Sharif named after himself.

The move comes as he faces more than a dozen pending corruption cases. And it doesnâ€™t stop there.

The three-time prime minister's brother, Shahbaz Sharif, the powerful chief minister of Punjab â€” the countryâ€™s largest province with a population of 110 million â€” is being investigated for money laundering, murder and terrorism.

Finance Minister Ishaq Dar, who is also a brother-in-law of Nawaz Sharif, was indicted last week on corruption, money-laundering and undeclared income charges. As the man in charge of Pakistanâ€™s faltering economy, heâ€™s faced calls from the opposition to resign.

Nawaz Sharifâ€™s three adult children, including his heir apparent Maryam Nawaz, also face graft investigations. Maryam Nawazâ€™s husband, Safdar Awan, was arrested by anti-corruption authorities on Monday. Her brothers, Hassan and Hussain, are wanted by the courts.

And Nawaz Sharifâ€™s replacement, Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, is being investigated for corruption.

The opposition is also facing legal woes.

Imran Khan, a cricket star-turned-politician, is being investigated by Parliament after allegations of harassment made by a party member as well as charges that he failed to declare his income. His deputy, Jahangir Tareen, is also being tried for corruption.

Sakib Sherani, a former adviser to the government, said ""a failing economy, rising regional and geopolitical pressure are being left unaddressed"" by the crisis.

The clamor for the powerful military to step in is increasing. Pakistan has already seen its armed forces seize power four times since gaining independence from Britain in 1947.

The political chaos comes as the ever-present threat of violent extremism and increasing tensions with nuclear-armed India loom over the region.

In late September, ISIS flags appeared mysteriously on one of the main roads of Pakistanâ€™s capital, Islamabad. On Thursday, more than 20 people were killed in a suicide bombing at a shrine in Balochistan â€” an attack claimed by the extremist group.

In a display of the ongoing gridlock, Interior Minister Ahsan Iqbal â€” the civilian head of security for the country â€” was stopped last week from entering a hearing of the Nawaz Sharif trial by the same paramilitary force that is supposed to report to him.

""At a time when Pakistan needs to consolidate its police, military and intelligence efforts to counter the potency of [ISIS], those efforts are at risk of being undermined by the customary tensions between Pakistanâ€™s generals and the political class,"" said Mosharraf Zaidi, a former foreign policy adviser to the government. ""This has the potential to cause real damage to Pakistanâ€™s hard-won victories against terrorists.""

Tensions are also mounting on the India-Pakistan border. On Wednesday, troops exchanged fire in what are â€œescalatingâ€ border clashes, according to the Foreign Office.

Pakistanâ€™s stability matters to South Asia and beyond.

As a linchpin of the American war in Afghanistan, the U.S. alliance with Pakistan hinges on security cooperation against terror groups and the passage of supplies to the some 11,000 U.S. troops there.

In August, President Donald Trump warned that Pakistan â€œhas much to lose by continuing to harbor criminals and terrorists,â€ a reference to the country's alleged support for militant groups like the Haqqani network, which targets U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan. Pakistan has long denied allegations that it helps and shelters militants.


Amid Trumpâ€™s strong words and threats of sanctions from U.S. legislators, Pakistanis are struggling with power cuts, food price inflation and a growing tax burden imposed by a government too distracted to administer to the worldâ€™s sixth-most-populous nation.

The chaos is having an impact on Pakistani living standards, with suddenly increased food and oil prices, said Atif Zafar, head of research at JS Global Capital, one of the countryâ€™s leading investment banks. The stock market has suffered its highest quarterly loss since June 30, 2008, he said.

The IMF has also warned that the Pakistan rupee is overvalued.

â€œThe most serious challenge confronted by the country is the deepening economic crisis. It is further aggravated by political uncertainty,"" said Hussain, the columnist. ""It is really a dangerous situation."""
Fox News,America,Washington,"Trump and Modi exchange hugs, herald stronger US-India ties","Hugging outside the White House Monday, President Donald Trump and India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi heralded an increasingly close strategic partnership as the U.S. branded a top militant from neighboring Pakistan as a ""global terrorist.""
Trump declared he was ""true friend"" of India and said relations between the two largest democracies have never been better. But there were some tensions in the inaugural meeting between the two populist leaders. On trade, Trump demanded fewer barriers for American companies exporting to India.
Speaking in the Rose Garden after their talks, Trump said: ""Both our nations have been struck by the evils of terrorism, and we are both determined to destroy terrorist organizations and the radical ideology that drives them. We will destroy radical Islamic terrorism.""
Modi, a Hindu nationalist but also leader of a nation with nearly 175 million Muslims, did not use the same, charged terminology. He stressed the importance of ""doing away"" with terrorist sanctuaries and safe havens, apparently reflecting Indian concerns about militants based in Pakistan, India's historical archrival. He said the U.S. and India will enhance intelligence-sharing.
Hours before Modi's arrival, the State Department imposed sanctions on Syed Salahuddin, the Pakistan-based leader of Hizbul Mujahideen, the main rebel group that fights against Indian control in the divided Himalayan region of Kashmir. India's foreign ministry hailed the move.
Trump has so far focused on outreach to China, India's other strategic rival, as he looks to Beijing to rein in nuclear-armed North Korea. But Washington and New Delhi share concerns about China's rise as a military power that have underpinned increasingly close relations in the past decade.
The Trump administration says it want to provide India with improved defense technology. The State Department on Monday approved the $365 million sale of a C-17 military transport aircraft to India. The administration is also set to offer a $2 billion sale of U.S.-made unarmed drones to help in surveillance of the Indian Ocean.
Although Modi's two-day Washington visit, which began Sunday, is lower-key than his previous three trips to the U.S. since he took office in 2014, it has included plenty of face-time with Trump. Modi later joined the president and first lady for dinner â€” the first dinner Trump has hosted for a foreign dignitary at the White House, although he has hosted the leaders of Japan and China at his resort in Florida.
Trump and Modi share a populist streak and a knack for social media, but their economic nationalist agendas could clash. While Trump champions the idea of ""America First"" and wants to stop the migration of jobs overseas, Modi has his own drive to boost manufacturing at home, dubbed ""Make in India.""
India is among the nations singled out by the Trump administration for their trade surpluses with the U.S., and it is also reviewing a visa program used heavily by skilled Indian workers. The U.S. deficit in goods and services with India last year was about $30 billion.
""It is important that barriers be removed to the export of U.S. goods into your markets, and that we reduce our trade deficit with your country,"" Trump said.
But Trump also lauded Modi's economic stewardship, and the praise was mutual. Modi, who invited the president and his family to visit India, extolled Trump's leadership qualities. He said the president's ""vast and successful experience in the business world will lend an aggressive and forward-looking agenda to our relations.""
The personal chemistry between the two leaders could prove as important as policy in setting the tone for the future. They appeared keen to show they got along â€” hugging twice during their joint appearance. They did not take questions.
When it comes to terrorism, Michael Kugelman, a South Asia expert at the Wilson Center, said the two leaders have a similar worldview â€” that ""it needs to be destroyed wherever it rears its murderous head.""
He said the designation of Salahuddin shows that Washington is willing to work closely with New Delhi on terrorism-related matters, although it remains to be seen if that signals a tougher policy toward Pakistan. India accuses Pakistan-based militants of launching attacks on its soil.
The two leaders voiced a joint interest in bringing stability to Afghanistan, where India has committed $3 billion in aid since 2001. However, in their public remarks, they skirted the contentious issue of climate change. New Delhi has been irked by Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris accord."
NBC News,America,,Sikh Americans Launch Ad Campaign That Looks to Push Back on Hate,"Sikh Americans are launching a million-dollar awareness campaign as a response to increasing hate violence and a lack of understanding about the religion in the United States.

The ""We are Sikhs"" campaign, which begins April 14 is timed with the Sikh New Year of Vaisakhi. It is being organized by the nonprofit National Sikh Campaign and is years in the making, funded by Sikh leaders and their families across a dozen cities, who have been swept up in anti-Muslim sentiment since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. Their beards and turbans â€” symbols of equality in a religion that opposes India's caste system â€” make Sikh Americans easy targets for the angry and uninformed.

â€œ'We Are Sikhs' is an effort to raise the awareness of the Sikh religion, including explaining and demystifying the significance of the turban,â€ Shawn Singh Ghuman, National Sikh Campaign communications director, told NBC News. â€œThe initiative will utilize tested television advertisements, an innovative website, targeted digital and social outreach, and most importantly, local grassroots events to affect change.â€

The ads, which will air on CNN, Fox News, and on TV stations in Fresno, California, home to a large Sikh community, make no mention of the more than 300 hate crimes reported by Sikhs in the U.S. since the 2001 terrorist attacks. Rather, they feature Sikh families explaining how the world's fifth-largest religion, founded in India, aligns with American values.

""Whether itâ€™s our belief in equality between men and women across all races and faiths, to our deep belief in community service and the freedom to pursue oneâ€™s own success through hard work, these values are fundamental to our identity as Sikh Americans,â€ Ghuman said.

Internet advertising will begin immediately as well, and subsequent TV ads are planned for at least three more cities with large Sikh populations.

The ads, developed in consultation with Republican and Democratic consulting firms, do not mention Republican President Donald Trump, whose candidacy hammered on illegal immigration and Islamic extremism. While fundraising events in Sikh communities across the nation coincided with Trump's rise, organizers insist the $1.3 million effort has no connection to the tough-talking president.

""It's a coincidence,"" said Gurwin Ahuja, a 27-year-old political operative who also helped organize the new campaign. ""Administrations have changed, and we still experience violence regardless of who's president.""

This type of religious outreach has some precedent. Muslim advocacy groups launched a billboard campaign in recent years, while others developed public service announcements soon after Sept. 11.

Corey Saylor, spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, praised the new effort, noting that Sikh leaders have ""not allowed bias to divide religious minorities.""

""Years ago, they could have said, 'Hey, we're not Muslims.' But they've always taken what to me was a very honorable stand that nobody should be targeted, period,"" he said.

Surveys commissioned by Sikh leaders found that nearly 9 in 10 American Sikhs have experienced negative reactions or hate language, Singh said. Subsequent polling by a Democratic firm revealed that 60 percent of Americans know nothing at all about Sikhs.


""When people see us, they think we're either religious extremists or terrorists,"" said Ahuja, a Cleveland native who worked in the Obama White House. He recalled schoolchildren once asking during a White House tour if he was a member of the Taliban.

Many Sikhs are still haunted by the 2012 shooting inside a Wisconsin temple that left six dead. More recently, the FBI is investigating an early March shooting of a Seattle-area Sikh man as a hate crime. Three weeks later, a man was arrested after attacking a woman inside a Sikh temple in Oregon.
Sikh Temples Feed the Soul and Body


Hundreds of Sikhs gathered this past Sunday at a temple in Hicksville, on New York's Long Island, that makes meals for the homeless. A woman led prayers from the Sikh holy book for much of the morning.

The Long Island Sikh community has escaped much of the violence that has plagued Sikhs elsewhere. But just four months ago, temple leaders said, a group of young men shouted in the parking lot outside: ""Get out of here, you Muslims!""



Rana Singh Sodhi's brother was shot to death outside a Phoenix-area gas station four days after 9/11 by a man who said he wanted to kill Muslims.

Sodhi says he recently spoke by phone with the killer, who is serving a life prison sentence. They agreed to work together to help educate the public about Sikhs if and when he gets out.

""It's a long process,"" Sodhi said. ""We all are Americans."""
CBS News,America,New Delhi,"Donald Trump Jr. calls Indian media ""mild and nice"" ","The U.S. president's son heaped praise on the Indian media and complained of coverage at home, as he neared the end of a whirlwind trip across India promoting Trump-brand luxury real estate. Donald Trump Jr. said at an Indian business summit Friday that life since his father's election ""has been difficult from a family standpoint,"" but that he'd enjoyed the coverage he'd received during this trip.

""I love the Indian media. They are so mild and nice,"" he said to audience laughter, describing how he felt his comments have at times been twisted by some U.S. news outlets. Even when Indian outlets are aggressive in their coverage: ""They've at least been fair,"" he said. 

Trump has met only with Indian reporters carefully selected by his team, and the media coverage of his visit often focused on the promised luxury of the real estate developments he is selling.

With summer already approaching, New Delhi is far too warm for cozy fires, but flames flickered on a video screen behind Trump Jr. as he was interviewed by a TV anchor with the channel co-hosting the Global Business Summit.

His speech was retitled by conference organizers only hours before it was delivered amid criticism he was pushing an ethics boundary by talking about foreign policy during a private trip focused on the family business. Very quickly, ""Reshaping Indo-Pacific Ties: The Era of Cooperation"" became ""A Fireside Chat with Donald Trump Jr. ""

Critics had said an international relations speech, especially while sharing a platform with Indian government officials, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was problematic because of the implication that he has his father's ear.

""I am concerned that Mr. Trump's speech will send the mistaken message that he is speaking on behalf of the president, the administration or the United States government, not as a private individual, or that he is communicating official American policy,"" Sen. Robert Menendez, ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a letter earlier this week to the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi.

Menendez said he expected the U.S. State Department and the embassy would treat Trump Jr. like any other American on private business.

On Thursday, White House spokeswoman Lindsay E. Walters said the Trump administration ""takes seriously its obligation to ensure that government resources are not used to provide a private benefit to anyone.""

The State Department and the White House have said the only support that was given for the trip was related to Secret Service protection for Trump Jr.

His India visit has already raised ethical concerns.

President Trump has pledged to stay away from any new foreign business deals during his term in office to avoid potential ethical conflicts. While the projects that Trump Jr. is promoting in India were inked before his father was elected, ethics experts have long seen the use of the Trump name to promote even existing business ventures as tricky territory.

Trump Jr. and his brother Eric have been running the Trump Organization, the family's real estate business, during their father's presidency.

Since Tuesday, Trump Jr. has been traveling to four Indian cities to meet business partners and buyers in the luxury residential projects that bear his family's name.

With five ventures under the Trump brand, India has the company's largest number of projects outside the United States. The Trump Organization charges a licensing fee to its Indian partners who build the properties under the Trump name. A luxury complex is already open in the central city of Pune while the others are in varying stages of construction in Mumbai and Kolkata and two in the New Delhi suburb of Gurgaon.

Speaking to an Indian TV station during his visit, Trump Jr. dismissed as ""nonsense"" claims that his family business is benefiting from his father's presidency and that critics forget the opportunities lost and don't give the family credit for doing the right thing."
CBS News,America,New Delhi,"In India, Obama and Modi talk personal bond","Seizing on their personal bond, President Barack Obama and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi voiced optimism Sunday that they could find common ground on defense, commerce and environmental issues. Obama said the two leaders had reached a ""breakthrough understanding"" in efforts to free U.S. investment in nuclear energy development in India.

Obama and Modi expressed hope that six years after a landmark nuclear agreement between the U.S. and India, the deal could begin to bear fruit.

The two countries had been at an impasse over U.S. insistence on tracking fissile material it supplies to India and over Indian liability provisions that have discouraged U.S. firms from capitalizing on a 2008 civil nuclear agreement between the U.S. and India.

The White House said the understanding on the India's civil nuclear program resolves the U.S. concerns on both tracking and liability.

""In our judgment, the Indians have moved sufficiently on these issues to give us assurances are resolved,"" said Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security adviser.

Rhodes said it would still be up to U.S. companies to assess the market and decide whether they wanted to partake. He said neither country needed to take legislative action to complete the agreements the leaders reached Sunday. Both men said Obama's visit to India has been more than symbolic and yielded substantive progress on trade, defense and climate issues.

""Your election and your strong personal commitment to the US-India relationship gives us an opportunity to further energize these efforts,"" Obama said.

""Barack and I have formed a bond, a friendship,"" Modi said. ""We can laugh and joke and talk easily on the phone. The chemistry that has brought Barack and me closer has also brought Washington and Delhi closer.""

The two men spoke jointly after a day of pomp and meetings.

Modi greeted Obama with an elaborate welcome at the country's sprawling presidential palace. Obama solemnly laid a wreath at a memorial honoring the father of India's independence movement, Mahatma Gandhi.

On Monday, Obama was to be the guest of honor at India's Republic Day festivities, making him the first U.S. president to attend the anniversary of the enactment of country's democratic constitution.

In a move likely to take some of the symbolic shine off Obama's trip, the White House announced shortly before his departure from Washington that the president was canceling plans to visit the Taj Mahal in Agra. The president and first lady had planned to tour the famed white marble monument of love on Tuesday, but instead the Obamas will go to Saudi Arabia to pay respects to the royal family following the death of King Abdullah."
CBS News,America,New Delhi,Palin: US-India relations key to world's future,"U.S. politician Sarah Palin stressed the importance of America's ties with India, saying they were based on the shared values of freedom and free-market capitalism, while sounding a warning note on China's rise during a speech Saturday in New Delhi.

The visit to India is a rare foreign venture for the ex-Alaska governor and reality TV star, who was John McCain's running mate in his failed 2008 campaign for president. The trip, which also includes a stop in Israel, is raising speculation Palin wants to burnish her foreign policy credentials ahead of a possible 2012 presidential run.

Palin told a well-heeled audience of Indian business leaders, professionals and socialites that U.S.-Indian relations were ""key to the future of our world.""

""We're going to need each other, especially as these other regions rise,"" she said, in an apparent reference to China, during a Q&A that followed a keynote speech titled ""My Vision of America.""

""Free people that make up a free country don't wage war on another free country,"" she said. ""I want peace on Earth.""

She questioned the Chinese military's ascent, saying the Communist country's stockpiling of ballistic missiles, submarines and ""new-age, ultramodern aircraft"" seemed unjustified when it did not face an outside threat.

""What's with the military buildup?"" she said. ""China's military growth can't just be for defensive purposes.""

Reporters who had been assured access were barred at the last minute. But the speech was shown on Indian television and in a live webcast.

Palin was coy about whether she planned to run for the White House, but at times sounded like she was campaigning. She took a swipe at President Barack Obama and what she described as his ""dithering"" response to the political upheaval in the Middle East, saying he ""should have done more for Arab protesters.""

Obama visited India in November during a wider Asian tour, affirming the country's growing importance on the global scene.

Palin said the Republican Party's apparatus was at times frustrating to deal with, but said presidents Ronald Reagan and Abraham Lincoln were role models and reasons for why she joined the party.

She also took aim at one of her favorite targets, the U.S. media.

She accused them of failing ""to set the record straight"" and joked that they willfully cost her and McCain the 2008 election.

""I will not sit back and take media criticism,"" Palin said. ""Too often, Republicans, I don't know, they kind of have the fighting instinct of sheep.""

Palin is due to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during her visit to the Jewish state.

CBS News,America,New Delhi,Obama gets a rare honor in India,"President Obama on Monday took in a grand display of Indian military hardware, marching bands and elaborately dressed camels, becoming the first American leader to be honored as chief guest at India's annual Republic Day festivities.

The crowd erupted in cheers as Mr. Obama, along with first lady Michelle Obama, emerged from his armored limousine and took his place on the rain-soaked parade route in the capital of New Delhi. The parade was the centerpiece of Mr. Obama's three-day visit to India, which is aimed at strengthening a relationship between the world's largest democracies that has at times been fraught with tension and suspicion.

President Obama's attendance at the Republic Day celebrations was unlike any other event he has participated in during his overseas travel as president. He spent about two hours on an outdoor viewing platform, an unusual amount of time given Secret Service security concerns. Mr. Obama nodded in approval as Indian tanks and rocket launchers, some of them Russian-made, rolled down the parade route and air force jets sped by overhead.

Republic Day marks the anniversary of India's democratic constitution taking force in 1950. Beyond the show of military power, the parade included ornate floats highlighting India's cultural diversity. Mr. Obama gave a thumbs-up to the acrobatic balancing act of several groups of men on motorbikes, while Mrs. Obama smiled broadly at dance performance by young children.

CBS News chief White House correspondent Major Garrett reported, however, that events unfolding in Yemen and Ukraine largely overshadowed the symbolism of Mr. Obama's visit over the weekend.

As fresh attacks by Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine cause increasing alarm in Washington, President Obama said he would ""look at all additional options available to us, short of military confrontation.""

In Yemen, it was the pro-Western government's collapse last week in the face of an uprising by Shiite Muslim rebels seemingly backed by ousted dictator Ali Abdullah Saleh which drew Mr. Obama's attention in Delhi.

The president alluded to concerns that the crisis in Yemeni leadership could allow al Qaeda's franchise in the country to grow, saying covert U.S. military operations would continue but acknowleding it was ""a long arduous process. It is not neat, it is not simple, but it is the best option we have.""

Following the parade, the Obamas were to attend a reception with dignitaries at Rashtrapati Bhawan, the sprawling presidential palace.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's invitation for Mr. Obama to attend the parade surprised White House officials. After some internal deliberation, the president ultimately decided to attend and has sought to use the visit to turn his burgeoning personal friendship with Modi into policy breakthroughs.

U.S. officials have welcomed Modi's efforts to forge deeper ties with Washington, despite his own difficult history with the U.S. Modi was denied a visa to visit the U.S. in 2005, three years after religious riots killed more than 1,000 Muslims in the Indian state where he was the top elected official.

Officials in both countries say Mr. Obama and Modi developed an easy chemistry when they first met in Washington last fall. The two leaders spent several hours together Sunday and heralded their close relationship.

Mr. Obama said Modi's ""strong personal commitment to the U.S.-India relationship gives us an opportunity to further energize these efforts."" And the Indian leader declared that ""the chemistry that has brought Barack and me closer has also brought Washington and Delhi closer.""

Modi is well aware that the U.S. leader's presence at a showing of India's military strength could upset Pakistan, New Delhi's bitter rival, and Washington's long-time ally in the subcontinent.

While Modi invited Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to his swearing-in ceremony in May, the Indian leader has consistently taken a tough tone with Islamabad. Relations between the U.S. and Pakistan have also hit rough patches in recent years, though counterterrorism cooperation has remained strong.

Mr. Obama and Modi heralded progress on defense and climate change, as well as breakthroughs on an impasse over implementing a landmark civil nuclear deal their countries agreed to in 2008.

While details on the nuclear breakthrough were scarce, U.S. officials said the governments had overcome their differences on two fronts: U.S. insistence on tracking fissile material it supplied to India and American business concerns with India's liability rules that could impact their legal responsibilities in the event of a nuclear power plant accident.

Officials said it would be up to U.S. companies to determine whether the new agreements with India adequately addressed their concerns.

Several American business leaders were joining Mr. Obama in New Delhi, including the chief executives of Disney, PepsiCo and Marriott. They were to join Indian executives at a business leaders' summit later Monday.

Mr. Obama was to close the visit Tuesday with a speech to young people. He had planned to tour the Taj Mahal, India's famed white marble monument of love, but scrapped that stop and instead will go to Saudi Arabia to pay respects to the royal family following King Abdullah's death.

Fox News,America,New Delhi,Â Trump Jr. to give foreign policy speech in India.," Donald Trump Jr., the eldest son of the U.S. president, is to make a foreign policy speech at a business summit during his whirlwind trip to India where he has been promoting Trump-brand real estate.

The business summit in New Delhi on Friday evening will be headlined by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Two government ministers are also scheduled to speak at the two-day conference.

Trump Jr. will be speaking about ""Reshaping Indo-Pacific Ties: The era of Cooperation.""

He and his brother Eric have been running the Trump Organization, the family's real estate business, during their father's presidency."
Fox News,America,,"Eric Trump on addressing gun violence, business in India ","   There's a lot changed, and I don't know if legislation can change that. You guys have been getting a lot of heat for your brother's travel to India and business that he's doing there. He gave a speech on Indo-American relations and you're getting hammered.

Bob Menendez said I'm concerned that Mr. Trump, your brother's speech, will send a mistaken message that he's speaking on behalf of the president, the administration or United States government, not as a private individual.

But he's communicating official American policy. I write to ensure that the U.S. Embassy presence in India will have no role in supporting Mr. Trump or the organization during his time in India, New York Magazine and the rest of that nasty comments about this. Any conflict there given the business interests there on policy and --

TRUMP: What don't we get hammered for? My brother was over there. We have a bunch of buildings in India. He's talking how the Indian people are wonderful people and enjoyed his experience over there and everything else and then all of a sudden you have this.

These the first people that say that the First Amendment should be protected until you say something that they disagree with and then they want to rip you to shreds. It's not right. He gave a beautiful speech.

He talked about how wonderful the country was. We've been over there for many, many years with projects, you know, and this is pundit's talking points, but there's very little that we can do that we don't get attacked from and you were talking about it in your open. I think you did so very, very beautifully.

I mean, there's nothing that we don't get attacked for because quite frankly the Democrats don't have their own platform. They don't have their own leadership. They've got no good ideas. They've got no good bench of candidate."
Washington Post,America,New Delhi,Trump project in India saw $15 million in sales after buyers were offered dinner with Donald Trump Jr.,"Donald Trump Jr.â€™s private business trip to India this week â€” during which he is expected to give a foreign policy speech alongside Prime Minister Narendra Modi, raising conflict-of-interest concerns â€” netted $15 million in real estate sales for a Trump Towers project on Monday alone. 
The younger Trump has spent the week promoting the familyâ€™s real estate brand across India, where the Trump Organization has more business entities than in any other foreign country. He has been attending private Â­lunches and dinners with potential buyers and local business leaders as well as enticing buyers to purchase residences in the latest Trump Towers project in Gurgaon, where luxury flats sell for as much as $1.6 million.
Full-page glossy advertisements urged buyers paying a booking fee of about $38,000 by Thursday to â€œjoin Mr. Donald Trump Jr. for a conversation and dinnerâ€ on Friday. Kalpesh Mehta, one of the local developers, told reporters Tuesday that they already had sold over $100 million worth of real estate in the towers â€” $15 million alone on Monday, after the Trump Jr. dinner offer appeared in newspapers. Construction on the Â­project is expected to finish in 2023. His visit also prompted questions in Washington. Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) raised concern in a letter sent Wednesday to the U.S. ambassador in India about the embassyâ€™s engagement with President Trumpâ€™s eldest son. Trump Jr. is set to give a speech at a global business summit in New Delhi on Friday titled â€œReshaping Indo-Pacific Ties: The New Era of Cooperationâ€ alongside Modi and other high-ranking Indian government officials.
â€œI am concerned that Mr. Trumpâ€™s speech will send the mistaken message that he is speaking on behalf of the president, the administration or the United States government, not as a private individual, or that he is communicating official American policy,â€ wrote Menendez, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee.
â€œGiven the potential to confuse Mr. Trumpâ€™s private business visit with having an official governmental purpose, I write to ensure that the U.S. Embassy presence in India will have no role in supporting Mr. Trump or the Trump Organization during his time in India, other than that necessary to provide any security support for the U.S. Secret Service,â€ Menendez wrote.  Menendez also asked whether the embassy will have any role in the buyersâ€™ dinner, which has raised concerns by watchdog groups.
[Donald Trump Jr. says he admires Indiaâ€™s poor people because of their spirit and smiles]
A spokesman for U.S. Ambassador Kenneth I. Juster said that Trump Jr. is visiting the country as a â€œprivate citizenâ€ and that the embassy had provided only routine support for his Secret Service detail, such as booking hotel rooms.

Juster is in the process of replying to the letter from Menendez, who also asked whether embassy staff had briefed or assisted Trump Jr., what steps the embassy had taken to make it clear that Trump Jr. is not speaking on behalf of the government and whether the State Department or Bureau of Diplomatic Security had spent funds on Trump Jr.â€™s trip.
State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert likewise said Tuesday that Trump Jr. is in India as a â€œprivate citizenâ€ and that she was not familiar with what was going to be in the speech or how it was put together.
Trump Jr., 40, is executive vice president of the Trump Organization, the global family real estate business that his father still controls. The company has licensed its name to five real estate projects in India, including residential towers in Pune, Mumbai, Gurgaon and Kolkata as well as a proposed office tower in Gurgaon, a suburb of Indiaâ€™s capital also known as Gurugram. Some of the Trump Organizationâ€™s local business partners have ties to prominent politicians and have been involved in tax and other investigations.

Unlike his sister and brother-in-law, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, Trump Jr. has no official role in the administration, although he attended a meeting with a group of Russians at Trump Tower in New York during the 2016 presidential campaign that is the subject of law enforcement and congressional scrutiny.
[Trump Towers buyers in India offered chance to meet Donald Trump Jr., raising ethics concerns]
The Trump Organization did not immediately respond to emails and calls requesting comment, but Trump Jr. said in a televised interview at the CNBC affiliate in India that his family had not received enough acknowledgment for the business they have lost because of self-imposed restrictions to avoid such perceptions of conflicts of interest.
â€œItâ€™s sort of a shame, because we put on all these impositions on ourselves and essentially got no credit for actually doing that,â€ Trump Jr. said in the interview. â€œFor doing the right thing,â€ he added.
Critics on Capitol Hill and elsewhere have pointed out that Secret Service agents assigned to protect the Trump sons accompany them on these private business trips to promote the familyâ€™s brand, racking up costly hotel bills and draining the agencyâ€™s budget.

In 2017, for example, a business trip to Uruguay by Trump Jr.â€™s brother Eric cost taxpayers $97,830 for hotel stays for Secret Service personnel plus embassy staff that supported the agents during the â€œVIP visit,â€ according to purchasing orders reviewed by The Washington Post.
Catherine Milhoan, a spokeswoman for the Secret Service, said in an email, â€œAs a matter of practice, the U.S. Secret Service does not comment on the specifics of protecteesâ€™ trips.â€
Published U.S. government rates for hotel rooms in Mumbai, Delhi, Pune and Kolkata â€” the cities Trump Jr. is visiting â€” range from a maximum of $273 per night in Pune to $309 in Mumbai."
Washington Post,America,New Delhi,Trump Jr. to give foreign policy speech while on â€˜unofficialâ€™ business trip to India,"The presidentâ€™s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., is making what has been dubbed an unofficial visit to India to promote his familyâ€™s real estate projects. But heâ€™s also planning to deliver a foreign policy speech on Indo-Pacific relations at an event with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. 
Beginning Tuesday, Trump Jr. will have a full schedule of meet-and-greets with investors and business leaders throughout India, where the Trump family has real estate projects â€” Mumbai, the New Delhi suburb of Gurgaon, the western city of Pune and the eastern city of Kolkata.
Indian newspapers have been running full-page, glossy advertisements hyping his arrival and the latest Trump Tower project under the headline: â€œTrump is here â€” Are You Invited?â€ The ads also solicited home buyers to plunk down a booking fee (about $38,000) to â€œjoin Mr. Donald Trump Jr. for a conversation and dinner.â€ Public relations executives working with two local developers arranging the Trump dinner declined to give specifics about the event.[Trump Towers buyers in India offered chance to meet Donald Trump Jr., raising ethics concerns]
During the visit, the 40-year-old Trump Jr., executive vice president of the Trump Organization, will take a break from his private promotional tour to give an address on â€œReshaping Indo-Pacific Ties: The New Era of Cooperationâ€ at a global business summit on Friday evening, co-sponsored by the Economic Times newspaper. Modi will also speak at the summit.
News that the Trump Organization would be offering buyers in the Trump Tower the chance to meet the presidentâ€™s son sparked criticism of potential conflicts of interest, and the fact that Trump Jr. will be giving a foreign policy speech while on a private business trip complicates the matter further, ethics experts said. The senior Trump did not divest himself of his businesses when he was elected president. Rather, he turned the day-to-day operations over to his older sons, Don Jr. and Eric, to run. Eric Trump told The Washington Post last year that â€œthe company and policy and government are completely separated. We have built an unbelievable wall in between the two.â€ â€œTrumpâ€™s company is literally selling access to the presidentâ€™s son overseas,â€ said Jordan Libowitz, the communications director for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which is frequently critical of the first family. â€œFor many people wanting to impact American policy in the region, the cost of a condo is a small price to pay to lobby one of the people closest to the president, far away from watchful eyes.â€
Critics have often complained of the high cost of Secret Service agents accompanying the Trump children on private business trips, straining the agencyâ€™s budget. The Trump Organizationâ€™s spokesman did not return requests for comment. Amit Sharma, a spokesman for the Gurgaon developer, said that they had sold apartments worth nearly $70 million since the Gurgaon towers project launched in early January. The buildings, where condos run from $780,000 to $1.6 million, have private elevator service, in-residence catering and an indoor swimming pool.
Trump Jr.â€™s tour of India, Sharma said, is a chance to â€œcelebrate the entire exercise.â€[Trump lashes out over Russia probe in angry and error-laden tweetstorm]
Along with the Trump Tower Delhi NCR (National Capital Region) in Gurgaon, projects include two residential towers in Pune, towers in Mumbai and Kolkata, and a planned office tower in Gurgaon, which is also known as Gurugram. The Trump Organization has more business entities in India than in any other foreign country, financial filings show, with licensing bringing in estimated payments of $1.6 million to $11â€‰million since 2014. 
Later this week, Trump Jr. will travel to Mumbai to open the demo unit at the golden-facade Trump Tower being built by the family development firm of Mangal Prabhat Lodha, a state legislator in Modiâ€™s Bharatiya Janata Party. That relationship has also sparked concern about potential conflicts of interest. As with most of its foreign deals, the Trump family licenses its name to the projects, collecting hefty royalty fees but avoiding risky investments.
â€œPart of the deal was that Trump would come and do promotions every couple of years,â€ said an employee of the Lodha Group, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the media.The election changed that, he said, meaning the adult children now have to step in.
â€œIdeally weâ€™d have preferred Ivanka,â€ he said, referring to the presidentâ€™s elder daughter, who is now an adviser to her father. â€œShe has a better public image. But it makes sense for Donald Trump Junior to do it.â€"
Fox News,America,,"Trump says US, India 'tied together in friendship' after Modi meeting","President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi vowed Monday to enhance the relationship between their two countries, with Trump vowing that â€œIndia and the United States will always be tied together in friendship and respect.â€
â€œThe future of our partnership has never looked brighter,â€ said Trump during a joint appearance with Modi in the White House Rose Garden. The president also thanked â€œthe Indian peopleâ€ for their efforts in Afghanistan and in levying new sanctions against North Korea, which the president said â€œhas to be dealt with and probably dealt with rapidly.â€
Trump also noted that both the U.S. and India have been affected by the ""evils of terrorism"" and the ""radical ideology that drives them"" before vowing to ""destroy radical Islamic terrorism.""
Working together, I truly believe our two countries can set an example for many other nations.
- President Donald Trump
Trump also attempted to inject a note of levity by describing him and Modi, leaders of the world's two largest democracies, as â€œworld leaders in social media.â€ The American president has approximately 32.8 million Twitter followers, while Modi â€“ who also makes prolific use of the platform â€“ has approximately 31 million followers.
â€œWeâ€™re believers [in] giving the citizens of our country the opportunity to hear directly from their elected officials and for us to hear directly from them,â€ Trump said. â€œI guess itâ€™s worked very well in both cases.â€
At the end of his remarks, Modi invited Trump and his family to visit India. The two men embraced as they concluded their remarks.
Earlier, Trump heaped praise on Modi during Oval Office remarks as a ""great prime minister"" who had brought economic growth to India. Modi recalled Trump's visits to India long before he was president and said he was looking forward to collaborating with him now that he is president.
""The relationship between the United States and India is very, very strong and very, very powerful,"" Trump said. ""We agree on most things. And I would say, by the end of the day we'll agree on everything. I have a feeling,"" he joked.
Hours before Modi's arrival, the State Department imposed sanctions on Syed Salahuddin, the Pakistan-based leader of Hizbul Mujahideen, the main rebel group that fights against Indian control in the divided Himalayan region of Kashmir. India's foreign ministry hailed the move.
The Trump administration says it wants to provide India the kind of defense technology it does to the closest U.S. allies. In a concrete indication of that, the U.S. State Department approved the $365 million sale of a C-17 military transport aircraft. The administration is also set to offer a $2 billion sale of U.S.-made unarmed drones to help in surveillance of the Indian Ocean.
Trump thanked Modi for India's purchase of U.S. military equipment. Since 2008, India has signed more than $15 billion in U.S. defense contracts.
Later Monday, Modi was scheduled to have dinner with the president and first lady -- the first dinner Trump has hosted for a foreign dignitary at the White House, although he has hosted the leaders of Japan and China at his resort in Florida.
Before going to the White House, Modi met separately with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.
Trump and Modi share a populist streak and a knack for social media, but their economic nationalist agendas could clash. While Trump champions the idea of ""America First"" and wants to stop the migration of jobs overseas, Modi has his own drive to boost manufacturing at home, dubbed ""Make in India.""
India is among the nations singled out by the Trump administration for their trade surpluses with the U.S., and it is also reviewing a visa program used heavily by skilled Indian workers."
Fox News,America,,"Asia is nervous about Trump, but US-India ties could improve","Some Asian nations are watching anxiously as Donald Trump prepares to take up the presidency, but for at least one major power in the region, India, the changing of the guard in Washington could strengthen ties.
During a brutal election campaign, where Trump's rhetoric on foreign partners was overwhelmingly negative, he was largely positive about India -- or at least its Hindu majority -- and its nationalist prime minister, Narendra Modi.
When Trump courted Indian-American voters at a rally in New Jersey in mid-October, he said, ""There won't be any relationship more important to us."" He praised Modi -- another populist who is savvy in using social media -- as a ""great man"" for championing bureaucratic reforms and economic growth.
There are other hints that Trump is well-disposed toward India.
He has done a lot of business there. A Washington Post analysis of Trump's pre-election financial disclosure found that of his 111 international business deals, the highest number -- 16 -- were in India. He stirred controversy last week over potential conflicts of interest by meeting with three Indian business partners who are building a Trump-branded luxury apartment complex in the city of Pune.
On Wednesday he selected South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, the daughter of Indian Sikh immigrants, to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations -- the first woman tapped for a Cabinet-level post in his administration. Haley has no foreign policy experience.
It remains a matter of conjecture how any of this will shape the approach taken by a Trump administration when he takes office Jan. 20. But Lisa Curtis at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank said it was ""easy to envision"" the U.S. and India working closer on counter-terrorism.
India hopes that Trump's promise to fight radical Islamic militants will mean more American pressure on Pakistan and less aid for India's historic archrival. Militants based in Pakistan are accused of launching cross-border attacks inside India.
Neelam Deo, who heads the Mumbai-based think tank Gateway House, said India would also welcome it if Trump builds a working relationship with Russia in fighting the Islamic State group.
But Deo predicted U.S.-India friction if Trump restricts non-immigrant visas for Indians to try to protect American workers. She said that 60 percent of India's information technology experts who work abroad go to the U.S.
Biswajit Dhar, an economics professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, said that how Trump approaches immigration is a major concern in India and tough action ""is going to rattle quite a lot here.""
Lalit Mansingh, a former Indian ambassador to the U.S., said reactions in India to Trump's election victory have ranged from vocal support from right-wingers to shock and disappointment among the liberal intelligentsia. He said people had noticed that Trump had attended election campaign events with Hindus rather than the broader Indian-American community.
India is 80 percent Hindu, but 14 percent of its 1.3 billion people are Muslims.
U.S.-India relations have advanced under President Barack Obama, particularly since Modi's election in 2014. When Modi addressed Congress this June, he described the U.S. as an ""indispensable partner"" and said together they could anchor stability and prosperity from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific.
Staunch U.S. allies like Japan and South Korea, which host American forces and depend on U.S. nuclear deterrence, have been unnerved by Trump's call for nations to shoulder more of the burden for security in Asia.
But that is less of a concern for India, which is not a formal ally of the U.S. It has expanded its military cooperation with Washington and purchased American hardware as it modernizes its armed forces. But it prizes having an independent foreign policy, as it did during the Cold War.
""India's interest in taking on a larger role fits in with Mr. Trump's view of U.S. friends and partners doing more in their own regions,"" said C. Raja Mohan, director of the Carnegie India think tank.
Trump plans to take an ax to the main economic element of Obama's Asia policy -- the Trans-Pacific Partnership. He said this week that he will end U.S. participation in the 12-nation trade pact. India is not involved in the agreement.
But India would be concerned if Trump adopted an isolationist stance and dialed back the U.S. presence in the Asia-Pacific.
""India is worried about China's dominance in this region,"" Dhar said."
Fox News,America,,Trump Jr. steals spotlight from Canada's Trudeau as India visits coincide,"Donald Trump Jr.'s business trip to India this week is having the unintended effect of overshadowing a coincidental visit to the same country by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
Trump Jr.'s arrival to promote real estate deals in four cities -- announced with glossy front-page ads in major Indian newspapers, reading ""Trump has arrived. Have you?"" -- has drawn the attention India's media and elites, while Trudeau's presence has barely registered by comparison.
The business deals Trump Jr. is promoting were inked before his father was elected in November 2016. The president pledged shortly after winning the White House that his businesses would not make new foreign deals while he is in office in order to avoid conflicts of interest that could jeopardize U.S. foreign policy.""We are refraining from doing new deals while my father is in office. We are turning down deals worth hundreds of millions of dollars around the world,'' Trump Jr. told the Times of India, describing how his fatherâ€™s presidency is costing the Trump Organization a lot of money in â€œopportunity cost.â€â€“â€“ ADVERTISEMENT â€“â€“
The potential agreements made over a decade cannot be signed now, Trump Jr. said, because of his fatherâ€™s pledge to avoid foreign deals. ""It costs us quite a bit of money in terms of lost opportunity.â€
In fact, whether the business deals get finalized at all remains uncertain, the president's eldest son said. â€œIf he remains in office for seven more years, I don't know whether those deals would remain on the table.â€
The trip, however, was expected to raise some concerns as Trump Jr. will be sharing the stage with Indiaâ€™s Prime Minister Narendra Modi at a New Delhi business summit and giving a speech on Indo-Pacific relations. Trudeau, similarly, embarked on a weeklong trip to India on Saturday to strengthen business ties and cooperation between the two nations.
But Modi and other top countryâ€™s figures so far have largely ignored Trudeau â€“ causing speculation that the government is purposely snubbing him over his appointment of Cabinet ministers with alleged ties to the Sikh separatist movement, which aims to create a separate state for Sikhs in India through armed or political struggle.
Modi did not greet Trudeau at the airport, instead sending a junior minister, and despite already being halfway through the trip, the Canadian PM has not yet met a single senior government minister.
But Trudeau denies friction between him and the Indian government, telling a Canadian news channel that he met the prime minister â€œvery recently.â€ He is also expected to speak with Modi on Friday."
Fox News,America,,Obama becomes first US president to take in India's Republic Day parade,"President Obama on Monday took in a grand display of Indian military hardware, marching bands and elaborately dressed camels, becoming the first American leader to be honored as chief guest at India's annual Republic Day festivities. 
The crowd erupted in cheers as Obama, along with first lady Michelle Obama, emerged from his armored limousine and took his place on the rain-soaked parade route in the capital of New Delhi. The parade was the centerpiece of Obama's three-day visit to India, which is aimed at strengthening a relationship between the world's largest democracies that has at times been fraught with tension and suspicion. 
Obama's attendance at the Republic Day celebrations was unlike any other event he has participated in during his overseas travel as president. He spent about two hours on an outdoor viewing platform, an unusual amount of time given Secret Service security concerns. Obama nodded in approval as Indian tanks and rocket launchers, some of them Russian-made, rolled down the parade route and air force jets sped by overhead. 
Republic Day marks the anniversary of India's democratic constitution taking force in 1950. Beyond the show of military power, the parade included ornate floats highlighting India's cultural diversity. Obama gave a thumbs-up to the acrobatic balancing act of several groups of men on motorbikes, while Mrs. Obama smiled broadly at dance performance by young children. 
Following the parade, the Obamas attended a reception with dignitaries at Rashtrapati Bhawan, the sprawling presidential palace. 
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's invitation for Obama to attend the parade surprised White House officials. After some internal deliberation, Obama ultimately decided to attend and has sought to use the visit to turn his burgeoning personal friendship with Modi into policy breakthroughs. 
U.S. officials have welcomed Modi's efforts to forge deeper ties with Washington, despite his own difficult history with the U.S. Modi was denied a visa to visit the U.S. in 2005, three years after religious riots killed more than 1,000 Muslims in the Indian state where he was the top elected official. 
Officials in both countries say Obama and Modi developed an easy chemistry when they first met in Washington last fall. The two leaders spent several hours together Sunday and heralded their close relationship. 
Obama said Modi's ""strong personal commitment to the U.S.-India relationship gives us an opportunity to further energize these efforts."" And the Indian leader declared that ""the chemistry that has brought Barack and me closer has also brought Washington and Delhi closer."" 
Modi is well aware that Obama's presence at a showing of India's military strength could upset Pakistan, New Delhi's bitter rival, and Washington's long-time ally in the subcontinent. 
While Modi invited Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to his swearing-in ceremony in May, the Indian leader has consistently taken a tough tone with Islamabad. Relations between the U.S. and Pakistan have also hit rough patches in recent years, though counterterrorism cooperation has remained strong. 
Obama and Modi heralded progress on defense and climate change, as well as breakthroughs on an impasse over implementing a landmark civil nuclear deal their countries agreed to in 2008. 
While details on the nuclear breakthrough were scarce, U.S. officials said the governments had overcome their differences on two fronts: U.S. insistence on tracking fissile material it supplied to India and American business concerns with India's liability rules that could impact their legal responsibilities in the event of a nuclear power plant accident. 
Officials said it would be up to U.S. companies to determine whether the new agreements with India adequately addressed their concerns. 
Westinghouse Electric Co., one of the companies that could benefit from the agreements, said in a statement that it was ""pleased that the U.S. government and the government of India continue to make progress to resolve issues that will enable Westinghouse and other U.S. companies to participate in India's growing nuclear energy market."" 
Westinghouse CEO Daniel Roderick was among the American business leaders joining Obama in New Delhi for meetings with Indian executives. 
Obama urged business leaders to find ways to seize the ""untapped potential"" that could unleash greater trade between the U.S. and India. And he pledged $1 billion in new financing to support the export of American-made products to India. 
The president was to close the visit Tuesday with a speech to young people. He had planned to tour the Taj Mahal, India's famed white marble monument of love, but scrapped that stop and instead will go to Saudi Arabia to pay respects to the royal family following King Abdullah's death."
Fox News,America,,"US looking to help India modernize its military, Pacom commander says","Defense trade between the U.S. and India has totaled about $15 billion over the past decade, and the leader of the U.S. Pacific Command says that spending rate could increase as the two countries work to modernize Indiaâ€™s military.
The U.S.-India relationship â€œplaces India on the same level that we have many of our treaty allies,"" U.S. Navy Adm. Harry Harris told the Press Trust of India.
""This is important, and I believe that together we will be able to improve India's military capabilities in significant and meaningful ways,â€ Harris said.India has also invested heavily in defense deals with other partners in recent years, including a $630 million missile defense deal signed in April with an Israeli aerospace firm, the Jerusalem Post reported.
The U.S. has cultivated its relationship with Indiaâ€™s military as part of efforts to keep peace in the Indo-Asia-Pacific region, the Times of India reported. Japan and Australia have also been regional partners, the report said.
Â â€œI think the trilateral relationship between India and Japan and the U.S., that relationship is very important,"" Harris told PTI, adding that Australia remains another key player.
India and the U.S. have conducted joint naval exercises in the Malabar region, on Indiaâ€™s west coast, since 1992, with Japan joining in 2015. Harris said the U.S. â€œcould explore together bringing Australia into the exercise,â€ however thatâ€™s â€œa decision for India to make.â€
President Trump spoke of the U.S.-India relationship in late June, when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the White House.
â€œBoth our nations have been struck by the evils of terrorism, and we are both determined to destroy terrorist organizations and the radical ideology that drives them. We will destroy radical Islamic terrorism,â€ Trump said at the time.
Modi did not use the same terminology, but stressed the importance of â€œdoing awayâ€ with terrorist sanctuaries and safe havens, apparently reflecting Indian concerns about militants based in Pakistan, India's historical archrival. He said the U.S. and India will enhance intelligence-sharing."
NBC News,America,New Delhi,"India, U.S reach landmark neuclear agreement","Reversing decades of U.S. policy, President Bush ushered India into the worldâ€™s exclusive nuclear club Thursday with a landmark agreement to share nuclear reactors, fuel and expertise with this energy-starved nation in return for its acceptance of international safeguards. 
Eight months in the making, the accord would end Indiaâ€™s long isolation as a nuclear maverick that defied world appeals and developed nuclear weapons. India agreed to separate its tightly entwined nuclear industry â€” declaring 14 reactors as commercial facilities and eight as military â€” and to open the civilian side to international inspections for the first time. 
The agreement must be approved by Congress, and Bush acknowledged that might be difficult because India still refuses to sign the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty. 
(That fact has complicated other relationships. Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said Friday that Australia will not sell uranium to India until it signs the treaty. 
(Downer welcomed the deal brokered by Bush and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, but he said Australia would not alter its longstanding policy blocking the sale of uranium, as it could result in other countries that have not signed the treaty making bids for Australian uranium.) 
Singh hails historic moment 
Bush, who has made improving relations with India a goal of his administration, said â€œIâ€™m trying to think differently, not stay stuck in the past.â€ Celebrating their agreement, Singh said, â€œWe have made history today, and I thank you.â€ 
The deal was sealed a day before Bush begins an overnight visit to Pakistan, a close ally struggling with its own terrorism problems. It was there on Thursday that at least one bomb ripped through the parking lot of the Marriott Hotel in Karachi , exploding windows in the nearby U.S. consulate. An American diplomat and three other people were killed in the bombing, about 1,000 miles south of Islamabad, the Pakistani capital, where Bush will meet with Pervez Musharraf, the military leader.

U.S. officials said there was evidence the U.S. diplomat, foreign service officer David Foy, was targeted. 
â€œTerrorists and killers are not going to prevent me from going to Pakistan,â€ Bush said at a news conference with Singh in New Delhi. 
Aides acknowledge risk 
Bush aides said there were security concerns about the president going to Pakistan but that officials were satisfied adequate precautions were in place. â€œBut this is not a risk-free undertaking,â€ said national security adviser Stephen Hadley. 
The U.S.-India nuclear deal was seen as the centerpiece of better relations between the worldâ€™s oldest and most powerful democracy and the worldâ€™s largest and fastest-growing one. 
India has more than 1 billion people, and its booming economy has created millions of jobs along with consumer demands that have attracted American businesses. Indiaâ€™s middle class has swelled to 300 million â€” more than the population of the United States. Still, 80 percent of Indians live on less than $2 a day. 
Bush acknowledged that Washington and New Delhi were estranged during the Cold War, when India declared itself a nonaligned nation but tilted toward Moscow. â€œNow the relationship is changing dramatically,â€ he said. 
Bush began the day by paying respects at a memorial to Mohandas K. Gandhi, Indiaâ€™s independence leader and apostle of nonviolence. Following tradition, the president and his wife, Laura, left their shoes behind. Bush also conferred with the CEOs of Indian and American businesses, religious leaders and the head of Indiaâ€™s political opposition.
Bush and Singh announced new bilateral cooperation on issues from investment, trade and health to agriculture, the environment and even mangoes. Bush agreed to resume imports of the juicy, large-pitted fruit after a 17-year ban. 
The president ended the day at a state dinner with Indian President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam under a crescent moon in a lush courtyard of the presidential palace. 
Sealing the deal with mango juice 
Waiters in red tunics and red-and-white turbans scurried to serve broccoli-almond soup, seafood and peach ice cream after toasts of mango juice by the two heads of state. 
The nuclear agreement drew fire from congressional critics. 
â€œWith one simple move the president has blown a hole in the nuclear rules that the entire world has been playing by, and broken his own word to assure that we will not ship nuclear technology to India without the proper safeguards,â€ said Rep. Edward Markey of Massachusetts, senior Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. 
Advertise
In New York, John Bolton, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, defended the deal. â€œIndia and Pakistan had never signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty and therefore, they werenâ€™t in violation of it by having nuclear programs,â€ he said. 
Bush said helping India with nuclear power would reduce the global demand for energy which has sent gasoline prices soaring. 
â€œTo the extent that we can reduce demand for fossil fuels, it will help the American consumer,â€ Bush said. 
It also could be a boon for American companies that have been barred from selling reactors and material to India. 
Critics have complained the deal rewards bad behavior and undermines efforts to prevent states like Iran and North Korea from acquiring nuclear weapons. The White House said India was unique because it had protected its nuclear technology and not been a proliferator. 
Administration rebuts critics 
The administration also argued it was a good deal because it would provide international oversight for a program that has been secret since India entered the nuclear age in 1974. 
â€œIn its largest sense, in the geopolitical sense, the agreement today removes a basic irritant in the relations between India and the United States over the last 30 years,â€ said Nick Burns, undersecretary of state for political affairs.â€ 
The agreement has no impact on Indiaâ€™s nuclear weapons program. â€œItâ€™s not a perfect deal in the sense that we havenâ€™t captured 100 percent of Indiaâ€™s nuclear program,â€ Burns acknowledged. 
The agreement grew out of an accord Bush and Singh signed last July to establish a new relationship in civil nuclear energy. 
The United States and other countries slapped sanctions on India and Pakistan after they conducted nuclear weapons tests 1998 but those penalties were lifted after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when the United States sought allies against al-Qaida. "
The New York Times,America,Jersey City,"With Trump Set to Meet Narendra Modi, Many U.S. Indians Are Hopeful","Â With Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India set to meet President Trump on Monday for the first time, many Indians in communities like this one have had high hopes for the relationship between the two leaders â€” both of whom swept to power as media-savvy political outsiders pledging to revive their national economies.
In a string of storefronts here in â€œLittle Indiaâ€ that pay tribute to Hindu deities, Yogi Patel, 52, runs the Laxmi Pan Center, which is named after the goddess of wealth and sells a betel nut breath freshener. He has lived in the United States for 32 years and is a strong supporter of Mr. Trump.
â€œTrump is doing the right thing. Heâ€™s doing good for U.S. citizens and America,â€ he said, switching between English and Hindi to explain that he grew up in Gujarat, the state that Mr. Modi led as chief minister before the 2014 election. â€œAnd I am from both countries.â€
But as Mr. Trump has tried to crack down on immigration and withdrawn from the Paris climate agreement, singling India out as a country that has gained unfairly from the accord, the meeting of the two leaders with nationalist leanings and sizable social media followings has taken on a more complicated tone for others in the Indian diaspora.
Mr. Trump is â€œa little bit unpredictable,â€ said Vasudev Patel, who voted for Mr. Trump and is the secretary of the Overseas Friends of Bharatiya Janata Party, USA, Mr. Modiâ€™s party. â€œNobody knows when he will make what comment. And the next day he will say he didnâ€™t say that. Heâ€™s like an Indian politician.â€ Of the roughly three million people of Indian descent in the United States, 65 percent are Democrats or lean Democratic, according to a 2012 survey by the Pew Research Center. But on both sides of the debate, political analysts say last yearâ€™s election has ignited a wave of political engagement among Indians in the United States, and that is also driving interest in this weekâ€™s meeting.
â€œMost immigrants who come are really trying to make a life for themselves and their families. Theyâ€™re really concerned about the mortgage on the house, the papers to get their green card, family back at home,â€ said Devesh Kapur, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and an author of â€œThe Other One Percent: Indians in America.â€
â€œThis has now become a wake-up call that they cannot stand as aloof,â€ he added.
The diaspora in the United States sees itself as a wealthy and powerful segment of the population, with Indian-born business leaders, including Microsoftâ€™s Satya Nadella and Googleâ€™s Sundar Pichai, rising to prominence in recent years.
The median income of an Indian-American household is $88,000, well above the $49,800 average for the United States as a whole, according to the Pew survey. And 38 percent of Indian-Americans have advanced degrees, compared with just 10 percent of the rest of the United States population.
â€œIndian-Americans or Indians here are politically active,â€ said Tanvi Madan, the head of the India Project at the Brookings Institution. â€œThey are in the policy space. They have integrated in a substantial way. You see them on prime-time television show and in sports.â€
Both Mr. Modi and Mr. Trump have made efforts to woo the migrant community.
Weeks before the election last year, Mr. Trump visited another Indian community in New Jersey, where he proclaimed that the two countries would be â€œbest friends.â€ Mr. Modi, once barred from the United States on allegations surrounding the deaths of hundreds of Muslims in Gujarat in 2002, held a rally for 19,000 people at Madison Square Garden on his first trip to the United States shortly after taking office.
The Indian prime ministerâ€™s meeting with the diaspora on Sunday in Washington was relatively low-key.
Those in the crowd, like Srujal Parikh, the executive vice president at the Federation of Indian Associations, were eager to voice specific concerns before Mr. Modiâ€™s visit to the White House. Some are concerned about the relationship between the two countries after Mr. Trump withdrew from the Paris Agreement. Others want the prime minister to address the Trumpâ€™s administrationâ€™s anti-immigrant comments and its tough stance on visas for skilled workers.
â€œI myself am an immigrant, so I always think this country is built on immigration,â€ said Mr. Parikh, a Democrat. â€œThese are the people that bring the country up or down.â€
â€œWe must be talking about the immigration issue. We must be talking about how they can make a bridge between the two countries.â€
Tensions ran particularly high this year when two Indian engineers were shot, one fatally, at a Kansas bar. The white suspect was indicted on federal hate crime charges.
Rai Das, 24, who works at a small Indian restaurant in Little India, talks of feeling scared lately while walking the streets of New York.
â€œThere is some sort of wave going on,â€ said Ms. Das, who moved to the United States two years ago to study data analysis. â€œI donâ€™t know why, but people are discriminating.â€
Yet Kiran Sethi, 52, the owner of Reema Jewelers across the street from the restaurant, was so torn by last yearâ€™s vote that she did not cast a ballot, despite being a Democratic supporter in the past. She believes the new administration will do more to create jobs for her two daughters, who earned college degrees in the United States and are looking for work.
â€œWhen I see them sitting at home for six months, I feel their pain,â€ said Ms. Sethi, adding that Indian Americans are a â€œwell respectedâ€ part of American society. â€œDo you know how hard we work? We try our best that our kids go to school and get a good education.â€
This weekâ€™s meeting could rest mostly on personal rapport. The two men may seem to have a lot in common, but Mr. Modiâ€™s asceticism stands in stark contrast to Mr. Trumpâ€™s flamboyant style.
Still, both leaders ushered in the meeting by posting on Twitter. As he landed in the United States, Mr. Modi tweeted his thanks to the president for his â€œwarm personal welcome,â€ while Mr. Trump referred to the Indian leader as a â€œtrue friend.â€
From his pan shop in Little India, Mr. Patel remained optimistic.
â€œTheir mind-set is the same,â€ he said, batting away concerns as he took an oversize stick of sugar cane to the juicer. â€œModi does good for India, and heâ€™s thinking of the public there. And Trump is the same here.â€"
The New York Times,America,New Delhi,"India Is Close to Buying a Russian Missile System, Despite U.S. Sanctions","Â Indiaâ€™s defense minister is visiting Moscow this week to finalize the purchase of a Russian missile defense system, Indian officials say, in a weapons deal that would violate American sanctions against Russia.
The potential $6 billion deal comes at a time when the Trump administration is both weighing more extensive sanctions against Russia and trying to forge a military alliance with India. Indian officials say the agreement could be finalized as soon as this week, with India purchasing five S-400 Triumf systems, an antiaircraft missile array that can also intercept missiles.
If the purchase goes through, the Trump administration would have to choose between punishing India for violating the sanctions or granting an exemption to avoid souring the relationship.
The United States has been trying to cultivate India as a strategic ally and a hedge against Chinese military expansion. Washington has typically dangled defense deals as a way to improve military ties with countries, and it has courted India aggressively. Lockheed Martin offered last summer to move the production of F-16 fighter jets from Texas to India if India agreed to buy the plane.
â€œIn the past few years youâ€™ve seen a massive transition where more equipment is being bought from the U.S. Thatâ€™s because the U.S. wants a closer relationship with India, and defense deals are essentially diplomatic deals,â€ said Shailesh Kumar, the Asia director of the Eurasia Group, a geopolitical risk consulting firm.  â€œMy suspicion is that America will not deem the S-400 purchase as sanctions-worthy,â€ Mr. Kumar said. â€œThereâ€™s too much at stake for bilateral relations. If the U.S. goes for sanctions, it will undermine the good will the U.S. has been trying to build up with India over the last two decades.â€ Washington is increasing pressure on Moscow over its meddling in American elections and over the poisoning of a Russian spy in Salisbury, England, last month. American officials told Reuters that additional sanctions on Russia could be announced this week, expanding on a previous round that passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress in August.
â€œWe are engaging with a range of countries to avert future defense acquisitions, and the secretary of state will take appropriate action when and if we determine sanctionable activity has occurred,â€ a spokeswoman from the State Department said in an emailed response to questions. The spokeswoman did not specify what action Washington would take if the deal went through.
Indiaâ€™s purchase of the S-400 had been stalled over the past year by pricing concerns, and an official at the Ministry of Defense said Thursday that negotiations in Moscow were ongoing.
The potential purchase of the Russian missile system, also referred to by NATO as the SA-21 Growler, demonstrates Indiaâ€™s continued reliance on Russian military hardware at a time when the United States is trying to increase its arms sales to the country.
Washingtonâ€™s military sales to India went from nearly zero a decade and a half ago to some $15 billion today. Over the past five years, the United States has edged up to become Indiaâ€™s second largest arms supplier, just behind Russia. Russia accounted for 62 percent of arms sales to India over the past five years, down from 79 percent from 2008 to 2012, according to the Stockholm International Peace Institute, which tracks military spending.

American officials acknowledge that Indiaâ€™s large stock of Russian equipment is a fact of life. But the pending S-400 deal is alarming to the Americans because it is a relatively new and state-of-the-art weapons system, not just an agreement to service existing equipment.
â€œThe Russians are angry at India for going to the Americans for a lot of equipment, because India was their backyard as far as military purchases went,â€ said Rahul Bedi of Janeâ€™s Information Group, which tracks defense sales and is based in London. â€œThe Indians are scrambling to curry favor again with Russians and the S-400s are a way to do it.â€
India will be hosting a defense exhibition next week, inviting global weapons manufacturers to showcase their hardware. The United States and Russia are both sending official delegations. Indiaâ€™s pending deal is also another potential setback to the United Statesâ€™ struggling Patriot missile defense system, produced by Raytheon. Turkey, despite being a NATO ally, signed an agreement to buy the Russian S-400 system in December, ignoring American concerns.
American officials have also tried to sway India to purchase Patriot missile systems instead of the S-400. But the Patriot system has faced recent scrutiny after it failed to protect Saudi Arabiaâ€™s capital from missiles fired by Houthi militants in Yemen.
â€œIndia wasnâ€™t very impressed with the Patriot compared with the S-400, which wins hands-down in capability, in its availability, service availability. Itâ€™s a more efficient system,â€ said Mr. Bedi of Janeâ€™s.
But, he added, â€œIndia requires so much, thereâ€™s enough food on the table for everyone to eat and have a go at it.â€

The New York Times,America,Washington,U.S. and India Mark a New Moment in Relations as Narendra Modi Speaks to Congress,"Â Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India condemned global terrorism and said during a lengthy address to Congress on Wednesday that growing economic ties benefit both his country and the United States.
â€œThe innovation strength of our two countries comes together in California,â€ said Mr. Modi, who visited California last year. â€œHere, the innovative genius of America and Indiaâ€™s intellectual creativity are working to shape new industries of the future.â€
Mr. Modi made clear that he intended the speech to hail a new moment in relations between the United States and India when he told Congress at the outset that he had started his visit to Washington with a trip to Arlington National Cemetery. He called it â€œthe final resting place of many brave soldiers of this great land.â€
â€œI honored their courage and sacrifice for the ideals of freedom and democracy,â€ Mr. Modi added.
Indian leaders have long been skeptical of American military power and have often been deeply critical of the Vietnam War and other military interventions by the United States. Celebrating American war dead, though, was a telling signal of what both sides say is a very different relationship between the two countries.
Mr. Modi has encouraged a continued American military presence in Afghanistan because he is worried that Pakistan will have unchallenged influence there once the Americans leave.

â€œYour contribution in keeping the region safe and secure is deeply appreciated,â€ Mr. Modi said, adding: â€œA commitment to rebuild a peaceful and stable and prosperous Afghanistan is our shared objective.â€
Almost exactly 31 years ago, Rajiv Gandhi, then Indiaâ€™s prime minister, also spoke of Afghanistan in an address to Congress. But he did it in the context of justifying the Soviet military presence there because, he said, Soviet troops were â€œinvited by the Karmal regime,â€ a reference to the Soviet-installed government of President Babrak Karmal.
The different references to Afghanistan are a measure of just how much relations between the worldâ€™s largest democracies have changed in three decades.
In another sign of a break with the past, Mr. Modi gave a strong endorsement for global institutions, most of them created with American leadership.
â€œGrowing uncertainties and political complexities â€” our engagement can make a difference by promoting cooperation, not dominance,â€ Mr. Modi said. â€œConnectivity, not isolation. Inclusive, not exclusive mechanism. Respect for global commons and, above all, for international rules and norms.â€
Then Mr. Modi made an explicit reference to China by endorsing the â€œfreedom of navigation on seas,â€ referring to disputes involving the South China Sea and Chinaâ€™s efforts to carve out part of those waters as its own.
Mr. Modi was the fifth Indian prime minister to address Congress, and the appearance represents a turnaround in his acceptance within the United States. For years Mr. Modi was barred from getting a visa to come here because of his role in 2002 riots in the Indian state of Gujarat that cost the lives of more than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims. But as he rose as a national political figure in India, United States diplomats sought to put that difficult history to rest.
Mr. Modiâ€™s decision to accelerate already-warming ties with the United States has been greeted in Washington with excitement and surprise.

On Tuesday, he held meetings at the White House with President Obama, where the two leaders formalized a wide range of agreements covering climate change, renewable energy, security and economic issues. Before Congress, Mr. Modi also repeated that India was open for business.
Mr. Modi is eager for greater foreign investment, and although he has failed to deliver many fundamental reforms that would make business easier to conduct there, the smaller steps he has taken and his obvious enthusiasm have persuaded some major investors to give India a try.
In his speech, Mr. Modi gave a nod to his difficulties in passing much of his economic reform agenda. Although Mr. Modiâ€™s Bharatiya Janata Party has a majority in the Lok Sabha, Indiaâ€™s lower house of Parliament, it does not have a majority in the upper house, the Rajya Sabha.

See Sample Privacy Policy Opt out or contact us anytime â€œMr. Speaker, Iâ€™m informed that the working of the U.S. Congress is harmonious,â€ Mr. Modi said to laughter. â€œIâ€™m also told that youâ€™re well known for your bipartisanship. Well, you are not alone. Time and again, I have also witnessed a similar spirit in the Indian Parliament.â€
Indiaâ€™s economy is now the fastest-growing large economy in the world, but jobs are not being created at anywhere close to the pace needed to employ the roughly one million Indians who come of age each month.
Mr. Modi also touched on the issue of climate change in his speech, but subtly reinforced the point that the willingness of India â€” the worldâ€™s third-largest carbon emitter â€” to cut its own pollution will depend on help from the United States.
â€œThe protection of the environment and caring of the planet is central to our vision of a just world,â€ he said, adding, â€œfor us in India to live in harmony with mother earth is part of our ancient beliefs.â€
But, he said, â€œOur partnership aims to balance responsibility and capacity and focuses on new ways to increase availability of renewable energy.â€
Mr. Modi has vowed to sharply increase the growth of solar power in India, but Indian diplomats have also pushed for commitments from the United States to make new solar power technologies available as cheaply as possible, either by waiving intellectual property fees or by providing favorable financing.
â€œThis has been the goal of our efforts in G20 and climate change summits,â€ Mr. Modi said, to a mixed ovation â€” lawmakers on the Democratic side of the aisle stood and clapped, while those on the Republican side mostly stayed seated.
Mr. Modi was forceful in his condemnation of global terrorism, a subject he dwelt on at length. â€œNot just in Afghanistan but elsewhere in South Asia and globally, terrorism remains the biggest threat,â€ he said, adding in a clear reference to Pakistan: â€œAlthough its shadow is spreading across the world, it is incubated in Indiaâ€™s neighborhood.â€
Indiaâ€™s long rivalry with Pakistan has meant that India has been a target of terror attacks funded and encouraged by Pakistan, most famously in the Mumbai terror attacks of 2008.
Some members of Congress have criticized Mr. Modiâ€™s human rights record, but the politics of a visit by an Indian leader have also changed. Before Mr. Modi spoke, the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. announced more than a dozen members of Congress who were said to be escorting Mr. Modi into the chamber.
There are 3.5 million Indian-Americans, and they are a highly successful immigrant group with both wealth and deep community connections, making them sought after by politicians. In just one example, some 40 percent of hotel rooms in the United States are owned or managed by Indian-Americans, according to Arun K. Singh, Indiaâ€™s ambassador to the United States."
The New York Times,America,Washington,"Narendra Modi Bolsters Indiaâ€™s Ties With U.S., Thanks (Partly) to Donald Trump","After decades of mistrust and fitful reconciliation efforts, India and the United States made a turn toward cooperation on Tuesday, and Donald J. Trump can claim at least some of the credit.
Indiaâ€™s prime minister, Narendra Modi, making his second visit to the White House in two years, announced a crucial step toward ratification of the Paris agreement to limit greenhouse gases, bringing the accord close to full implementation.
The two sides also announced that they intended to complete a deal in which India will buy six nuclear reactors from Westinghouse by June 2017, fulfilling an agreement struck in 2005 by President George W. Bush. The price is still under discussion, but more difficult issues like liability have been resolved.
â€œWe continue to discuss a wide range of areas where we can cooperate more effectively in order to promote jobs, promote investment, promote trade and promote greater opportunities for our people, particularly young people, in both of our countries,â€ President Obama said in the Oval Office during the meeting.
Mr. Modi responded with his own praise of the burgeoning partnership. When President Obama visited India in January 2015, Mr. Modi referred to him as â€œBarackâ€ and thanked him for his â€œdeep personal commitmentâ€ to their friendship. In the Oval Office on Tuesday, Mr. Modi referred to the president as â€œmy friend Obama.â€
â€œThe United States is well aware of the talent that India has,â€ Mr. Modi said in Hindi. â€œWe and the United States can work together to bring forward this talent, and use it for the benefit of mankind and use it for the benefit of innovations and use it to achieve new progress.â€
Mr. Modi has made clear that he intends to set aside decades of standoffishness â€” rooted in Indiaâ€™s colonial experience â€” to cement closer ties with Washington, in part because the next American leader may not share President Obamaâ€™s enthusiasm for India.
The news media in India has extensively chronicled comments by Mr. Trump that critics have said were racist, his â€œAmerica Firstâ€ views and his unorthodox campaign. While Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has said little about India, his vows to tighten immigration policies worry Indian officials.
â€œModi wants to get as much as he can out of Obamaâ€™s last months in office,â€ said Ashley J. Tellis, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
For the Americans, the most important part of Mr. Modiâ€™s visit was his announced intention to formally join the Paris climate change agreement by the end of this year. So far, countries representing about 50 percent of global emissions have announced that they will submit legal paperwork to the United Nations documenting their compliance with the deal.
The pact will become binding when at least 55 countries representing 55 percent of global emissions formally join. The inclusion of India, the worldâ€™s third-largest emitter after China and the United States, would guarantee that the deal will go into effect before the next American president takes office.
Mr. Trump has vowed to â€œcancelâ€ the Paris climate agreement if elected, something Mr. Obama is eager to prevent. Once the accord enters into legal force, no nation can legally withdraw for four years.â€œIf the Paris agreement achieves ratification before Inauguration Day, it would be impossible for the Trump administration to renegotiate or even drop out during the first presidential term,â€ said Robert N. Stavins, the director of the environmental economics program at Harvard.
Mr. Obama and Mr. Modi also announced a separate agreement to cut the use of hydrofluorocarbons, potent planet-warming chemicals produced by coolants in refrigerators and air-conditioners. India and the United States have been at odds on the details of such a deal, but the agreement announced on Tuesday means both governments now expect in October to sign on to an international accord to phase out the chemicals. Phasing out the chemicals could reduce by 25 percent the expected warming of the planet by the end of the century.
â€œThis is the most significant step the international community could takeâ€ to reduce climate warming, Brian Deese, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama, said in a call with reporters.
The two sides also announced joint efforts for the United States to invest in Indiaâ€™s renewable energy development, including the creation of a $20 million finance initiative.
The last time Mr. Modi visited, in September 2014, he was invited to dinner but announced that he was observing a religious fast. So Mr. Obama had the awkward task of eating before a guest who sipped only water. This time, at a working lunch, Mr. Modi ate.
On Wednesday, Mr. Modi will become the fifth Indian prime minister to address both houses of Congress.
The two countries finalized a deal that allows their forces to help each other with crucial supplies, and the United States formally recognized India as a major defense partner, which should allow India to buy some of the most sophisticated equipment in the United States arsenal.
Indiaâ€™s increasing willingness to form military partnerships with the United States is, in part, a result of its deepening worries about China. Recent patrols by Chinese submarines in the Bay of Bengal have unnerved New Delhi, and a 2014 visit to India by the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, did nothing to soothe Indian sensibilities, as Chinese troops made an incursion into border territory that India claims as its own.
Chinaâ€™s refusal in the months since to resolve the territorial claims at the heart of the standoff has quietly infuriated Indian officials.
Another reason Washington and New Delhi have grown so close is the increasingly testy relationship between the United States and Pakistan, Indiaâ€™s longtime rival. Although Pakistan is formally an ally of the United States, American officials have made clear that India has displaced Pakistan in American interests and hearts.
â€œWe have much more to do with India today than has to do with Pakistan,â€ Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter said in April. â€œThere is important business with respect to Pakistan, but we have much more, a whole global agenda with India, agenda that covers all kinds of issues.â€"
BBC News,Britain,,Iran's shadow over India-US relations,"The newly strengthened India-US relations seem to be overshadowed by Delhi's insistence on using diplomacy to resolve the Iranian nuclear controversy. 
At the current board meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna, the United States, Germany, France and Britain are lobbying hard to report Iran to the UN Security Council for its nuclear activities. 
Diplomats say they have distributed a draft resolution to the board and it is expected to be voted on later this week. 
However, the US-led initiative may not have the required majority as countries like Russia, China and India have expressed their reservations over referring the Iran issue to the Security Council. Â India cannot sit on the fence anymore. It may have to make a choice. Either way it is going face problems 
Professor P R Kumarasamy, Jawaharlal Nehru University
India, whose support for the resolution is considered to be crucial, wants to give more time for Tehran and use diplomacy to resolve the nuclear controversy. 
Precarious situation 
But Americans seem to have been taken aback by New Delhi's stance. 
""If New Delhi decides to vote against the resolution that would definitely put obstacles at least in the nuclear deal signed in July 2005,"" says Henry Sokolski, executive director of the Washington-based Non-proliferation Policy Education Centre. 
After decades of mutual suspicion during the Cold War, India and the US signed a landmark nuclear deal in July. 
The pact allows Washington for the first time to help India's civilian nuclear programme, even though India is not a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). 
In addition to the nuclear deal, the two countries have also agreed to cooperate in defence and space programmes. 
India felt its ties with the US had entered a new phase. But the Iran issue has come as a jolt to both sides. 
Earlier this month the Bush administration came under strong criticism from some members of the US Congress for the proposed nuclear deal, which requires the Congressional approval. 
Congressmen expressed anger over India's apparent support for Iran's nuclear programme. 
Now New Delhi is in a precarious situation. After obtaining nuclear weapon capability in 1974, India may not have the moral right to ask Iran to give up its nuclear ambitions. 
But at the same time, it cannot afford to risk the ire of the US and the European Union by siding with Iran. 
The reality for India is that it is struggling to meet its energy demands. 
It currently imports 70% of the crude oil it needs and its energy demands, both in oil and gas, are expected to double by 2020 as the country's economy grows rapidly. 
Gateway 
India needs energy-rich countries like Iran. 
Earlier this year, Iran and India signed a $22bn deal for Tehran to supply five million tonnes of gas a year to India. 
The proposed gas pipeline project is expected to come through Pakistan. 
Â 
Iran insists it wants civilian nuclear power, not weapons
For months, Washington has been conducting behind the scenes diplomacy with India, urging it to rethink such ambitious projects with Iran. So far, Delhi has not given in to the US pressure. 
Analysts say that India-Iran relations have been steadily evolving over the years. 
A declaration in January 2003 clearly states the intentions of the two countries for a strategic partnership. In that sense, India's current position should not come as a surprise. 
Nevertheless, India's options seem to be extremely limited. 
""India cannot sit on the fence anymore. It may have to make a choice. Either way it is going face problems,"" says Professor P R Kumarasamy of the Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi. 
With nuclear power accounting for only 2.7% of its total energy production, India has more reasons to side with Iran as nuclear deals with the US is not expected to meet its requirement in the near future. 
The India-Iran partnership goes beyond the proposed gas pipeline. 
India has the second largest Shia population in the world and improving ties with Iran could send encouraging signals for the nearly 20 million Shias in the country. 
The two countries have also been stepping up their military co-operation and Delhi is keen to have a foothold in Afghanistan using Iran as an entry point. 
If a key planned land route to Afghanistan is completed, Iran could be India's gateway to the land-locked Central Asian countries. 
Also, any decision to side with the US could undermine India's position amongst Non-Aligned and other developing countries. 
Politically this could be a risky venture for the Indian coalition government as some of the members of the coalition have raised strong objections to the idea. "
BBC News,Britain,Washington,Major push for India-US relations,"The current visit of Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to the United States is expected to lead to a deeper and broader strategic partnership between the two countries. 
The enthusiasm among both US and Indian officials to push the relationship to a much higher level is palpable. 
The Bush administration is pulling out all the stops to welcome Mr Singh to the White House to show its seriousness about engaging with India. 
Mr Singh will address a joint session of the US Congress - a rare honour granted to close allies - where there is bipartisan support for stronger relations. Â The rise of India and China is more important than the disintegration of the Soviet Union or the unification of Germany 
Robert Blackwill
Former US ambassador to India
He will be accompanied by a high-level delegation that includes Foreign Minister Natwar Singh, Deputy chairman of the Planning Commission Montek Singh Ahluwalia and Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran. 
The two sides are working on agreements covering science and technology, energy, education, agriculture and space and nuclear cooperation. 
There are also attempts to make India a base to manufacture drugs to treat HIV-Aids. 
News focus on India 
The push for a broader partnership with India has gained momentum during the second Bush Administration as the US builds alliances in Asia. 
Much of the credit for this new focus on India has gone to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and her close advisers who believe India's geo-political importance is growing given its expanding economy and military strength. 
Â 
Condoleezza Rice is credited with improving the relationship with India
The Bush Administration has publicly said it wants to help India become a world power. 
President Bush is expected to announce US willingness to help India overcome its serious energy needs with nuclear technology - something the US has long denied India because it has not signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
There is, however, considerable opposition within US policy circles to treating India as an exception to the nuclear non-proliferation regime. 
But the US president has been pushing for the use of nuclear energy as a way to meet the growing global demand for oil. 
Analysts say he may invite India to join the US as a partner in international nuclear research projects, something that Indian scientists have wanted for some time. 
Business and defence ties 
The two leaders are due to issue a joint statement after their official talks, outlining their vision for the future. 
Indian officials expect that Mr Bush will end the remaining sanctions imposed against India after Delhi conducted nuclear tests in 1998. Â 
Defence ties are also on the agenda
Indian officials say that one of the highlights of the visit will be the newly constituted chief executive officers (CEOs) forum, which includes top business leaders from both countries. 
Indian Ambassador Ronen Sen said 10 CEOs each from both sides covering a variety of industries will advise both governments on how to increase US investment in India and start joint production in the crucial defence sector. The recently concluded defence framework agreement envisages US defence corporations jointly producing and marketing weapons to third countries. 
'Convergence of interests' 
A report released on Thursday by the Washington-based think tank, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, recommends not only greater space and nuclear cooperation between the US and India but says Washington should support India's aspirations for a permanent seat in the UN Security Council. 
While US support for India's bid for a seat at the UN top table seems unlikely, there will be other concrete achievements, say both Indian and US officials. 
Robert Blackwill, US ambassador to India in the first Bush administration, said while releasing the report that India was a natural partner for the US given the convergence of national interests of both countries. 
""The routes of the international system are changing right now. The rise of India and China is more important than the disintegration of the Soviet Union or the unification of Germany,"" he said. "
BBC News,Britain,,Obama in India: Country is 'lynchpin' in US's pivot to Asia,"US President Barack Obama has attended India's annual Republic Day parade on the second day of his visit to the country. 
Following the ceremonies, he attended a forum of business executives, where he and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi touted the economic co-operation between their countries.
Former US Ambassador to India Timothy Roemer says the trip signals an important step in US-India relations - as well as in President Obama's greater foreign policy agenda.
""India is a lynchpin as he has looked at this new pivot - or rebalance - to Asia,"" Mr Roemer said in an interview with the BBC's Katty Kay."
Huffington Post,America,,India's Pivotal Role In America's Rebalance To Asia,"The recently released National Security Strategy document of the United States reflects the diverse security challenges facing the US: the crisis in Ukraine, rise of the Islamic State, Iran's nuclear ambitions and an ever more powerful China. It urges Americans to use ""strategic patience"" rather than reflexive actions to address global security challenges by having a long-term view. The Obama administration has often been criticised for being unable to respond quickly to crises. This subsequently has led to a chasm on security issues between the Obama administration and congressional hawks rallying for a more muscular foreign policy. However, there is merit in Obama's policy of diplomatic engagement. The US is pursuing long-term strategy through strategic and diplomatic means and enhanced bilateral undertakings in the Asia-Pacific region. The National Security Strategy document signals that the US is modernising its essential bilateral ties with allies Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, invigorating ties with the Philippines and strengthening its strategic partnership with India. President Obama has deftly deployed diplomatic tools to safeguard and propel American interests in the complex Asia Pacific region. Strategic moves like enhancing interoperability with and among allies and defence postures ensures that the US engages with a rising China from a 'position of strength', says the document. Large-scale military deployment in the region runs the risk of alienating China which can escalate into a theatre of conflict with already competing maritime claims and an unstable North Korea. The US and China share a close economic relationship and depend on each other for vitalisation of their respective economies.
In 2011 the Obama administration issued several announcements (see for example here) indicating that the United States would be expanding and intensifying its role in Asia Pacific. President Obama's Pivot to Asia policy is smart and powerful as the Asia Pacific - the fastest growing, most populous, most dynamic region in the world - economically presents ample opportunities for American leadership. Deputy Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken speaking in Tokyo on February 13, 2015 stated that President Obama's strategic decision to rebalance America's engagement and resources towards the Asia Pacific region is simple as nowhere in the world are economic and strategic opportunities clearer.Strategically this region is significant as an engine of global economy with national rivalries steeped deep in history. Simultaneously, advancing talks on the Trans-Pacific Partnership to sustain American economic growth and Made in America exports has been the cornerstone of Obama's economic policies. There are signs that the US is focusing with renewed vigour on providing political commitment to the region. Several factors such as a resurgent American economy, reduced dependence on oil from the Middle East and a partial draw down of forces from Afghanistan have created a conducive geopolitical landscape to revitalise American efforts in the Asia Pacific. Recent reports suggest that the US Navy is considering regular docking of warships in Australia. As a part of expanding maritime cooperation, the US is also increasing the number of Marines at a base outside Darwin. Some commentators have been critical of the United States not maintaining a large forward deployed military presence in the Philippines, Singapore and Australia. However, a large military presence in the region does not necessarily assure that America will be the ultimate guarantor of peace and stability, and President Obama is aware of the limitations of the American military. 
While Washington can actively support and bolster the capabilities of allies and partners in the Asia Pacific, there are genuine limits to heavy military deployment in Asia. The US has maintained that the rebalance to Asia is not aimed at pursuing a containment policy towards China. The US and China share a close economic relationship and depend on each other for vitalisation of their respective economies. Thus, without intensifying tensions in the region by military deployment, America is tactically recalibrating its political commitment to the region. India and the US are faced with treading the tightrope of realpolitik. They must manage the rise of an assertive China whilst maintaining a vital economic relationship with the country.Of notable significance in the American rebalance to Asia is India's role as the 'lynchpin' of the strategy. With a sense of cautious optimism in its recalibrated economic growth, India is making concerted efforts to carve out an enhanced role for itself in the Asia-Pacific region. India is an important partner for the United States in Asia for strategic and economic reasons. There are synergies between the US Pivot to Asia and India's Act East Policy -America views India as an active partner to provide security and promote stability in the region. The US-India Joint Strategic Vision inked during the President Barack Obama's latest visit to India is rich on both symbolism and substance. The two democracies bridge the Asia-Pacific and Indian Ocean and it is this connectedness that forges a closer partnership between the US and India. Simultaneously the two countries are also important drivers of regional and global growth. 
It is understood that decisions taken by India and America will shape international security order in this region. India is also trying to enhance security ties with other Asian powers like Japan and Australia. Understandably, the US is interested in enabling India develop capabilities to better respond to diplomatic, economic and security challenges in the region. However, India and the US are faced with treading the tightrope of realpolitik. They must manage the rise of an assertive China whilst maintaining a vital economic relationship with the country.
In spite of several criticism of the American rebalance strategy due to the lack of political will and limited American military forces on the ground, the strategy is long term, live and kicking and will serve as a legacy of President Obama's foreign policy initiative. Presently the Asia Pacific is synonymous with growth and economic development and it is in the best interests of all the countries in the region to maintain peace and stability of for future economic progress. The Obama administration is demonstrating 'strategic patience' in diplomatically engaging the region and expanding the scope of security relations with allies (ranging from the US-Japan Space Security Dialogue to considering warship presence in Australia to joining military drills with South Korea and bolstering capabilities of partner countries). Reportedly, there are also emerging talks of reviving the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QSD).
A restrained American military deployment will help to de-escalate tensions and prevent the already strategically vulnerable region from becoming another flashpoint of crisis. India for its own part is focused on expanding its comprehensive national power and deepening cooperation with other maritime democracies to shape the region's balance of power in favour of a multipolar Asia."

During the meeting here -- the first cabinet-level interaction between the two countries under the Trump administration -- Ross is believed to have said that US has started the process of reviewing H1B visas issues and no decision has been taken on it yet, sources said.

Taking up the case of Indian IT companies and professionals, Jaitley told Ross about the contribution of highly skilled Indians in the economic development of the United States and India and stressed that they should continue to do so, which is in the best interest of the two countries, an Indian official said.

Ross is understood to have said that whatever the outcome of the review process, the Trump administration's objective is to have a merit-based immigration policy that gives preference to highly skilled professionals.

The executive order signed by Trump early this week calls for a review of H-1B visas by the departments of State, Labour, Homeland Security and Justice.
Jaitley, leading an Indian delegation, arrived in Washington DC yesterday morning to attend the annual Spring meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
Over the next two days, the Finance Minister is scheduled to hold a series of bilateral meetings with his counterparts from the US, Australia, France, Indonesia and Sweden. He is also likely to meet finance ministers from neighbouring Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.
Stressing that India-US relationship has bipartisan support in both the countries, the Finance Minister in his meeting with the commerce secretary said the two largest democratic countries of the world over the years have developed z strong strategic, economic and defence relationship.
The three phone conversations that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Trump have had, along with the officials meeting, has shown that the two governments are going to build on this momentum in the years to come, the official said.
Briefing Ross on India's growth story, Jaitley is believed to have given an him insight into a series of ""far reaching reforms"" being undertaken by the Modi government post-demonetisation including the Goods and Services Tax (GST).
Jaitley said the two countries should be able to move towards achieving the goal of USD 500 billion per annum in bilateral trade in the next few years.

It also said that that the US is making every effort to ensure that India become a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) by the end of this year.Making a rare appearance before a Washington audience, Peter Lavoy, the White House's point person for South Asia, said that India-US ties are the ""most dynamic relationship"" for the US as he listed the Obama administration's achievements in strengthening the relationship between the two largest democracies of the world.""It (Uri) was a clear case of cross-border terrorism.

Huffington Post,America,,Why Security Cooperation Is One Of The Most Promising Aspects Of India-US Ties,"Security cooperation today includes both some of the most promising aspects of US-India ties.
For anyone who worked on US-India relations before the big transformation took place at the end of the Cold War, this statement comes as a surprise.India-US security ties reflect two key strategic convergences. First, Indian and US interests in the Indian Ocean and Asian security are broadly aligned. Both countries want constructive relations with China, neither wants China to be the dominant power in Asia, and both are wary of China's expanding presence in the Indian Ocean. Indian strategists generally refer to China as India's biggest strategic challenge, though this is a perspective the government prefers not to articulate publicly as policy. This US-India policy alignment was best illustrated in the joint statement issued by President Barack Obama and Prime Minister Narendra Modi during Obama's visit to India in January 2015.In contrast to the broad strategic understanding on China, there is a persistent sense in India that the US does not fully appreciate India's concerns about Pakistan and Afghanistan.Second, India now sees its economy as a source of power. This gives Indian Ocean security a higher profile in India's strategic outlook. The US role in the Indian Ocean and further east is now regarded as one of the ways of protecting India's economic future. India's economic surge starting in the 1990s changed maritime and naval issues from a backwater to one of the lead sectors of the US-India security partnership, and the two countries have just begin an annual Maritime Security Dialogue. This fits in well with the Obama administration's ""rebalance"" to Asia, predicated on a network of strong partnerships around Asia, with India as a critical participant.In keeping with their deepening strategic understanding, the United States and India in July 2015 extended their defence cooperation framework agreement for another 10 years. Each successive agreement has expanded the areas for cooperation. This time, the list gave a higher profile to technology transfer and defence co-production, two critical Indian priorities. Remarkably, the proposed Logistics Support Agreement, normally a required feature of US defence trade, which had been given up for dead about two years ago, was revived in a form more palatable to India when Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter visited India in April 2016. The two countries have been working toward projects on aircraft carrier design and operations and jet engine technology. US manufacturers lost a bid to supply a large order of medium multi-role combat aircraft, but defence trade has increased, topping $9 billion between 2008 and 2013.
Stumbling blocks
At the same time, the two countries also have some important differences. Differing views on Pakistan limit the scope of the strategic conversation. For India, Pakistan is the source of its terrorism problem. For the United States, Pakistan is an important, albeit problematic, strategic partner, and a country the US prefers to deal with quite separately from India. In contrast to the broad strategic understanding on China, there is a persistent sense in India that the United States does not fully appreciate India's concerns about Pakistan and Afghanistan.Successful US negotiators need to listen before delivering their talking points, and to understand India's priorities -- even if they do not share them.The second major obstacle concerns the two countries' visions of their global role. For the United States, that role starts with leadership. Washington has an expansive view of where its interests are engaged. For India, the cardinal requirements of foreign and security policy are maintaining predominance in the immediate region and protecting ""strategic autonomy,"" thus avoiding excessive entanglement with powerful countries. This makes India ambivalent: enthusiastic about incorporating advanced US technology into its defence set-up and about keeping the US friendly in the areas most important to Indian security, but wary of any visible alignment with U.S. policy. This also means that on defence trade, Indian and U.S. priorities are not always in sync: India wants the latest technology while the United States wants to build a defence relationship.
A third challenge is the mismatch between the two countries' governmental structures dealing with defence. India's defence purchasing procedures are designed to maximize domestic production and avoid any accusation of corruption -- and if that means decisions take years, so be it. The US defence sales arrangements are legally subject to Congressional approval requirements -- and hence give rise to the Indian charge that the US is an unreliable supplier. The Indian Defence Ministry is chiefly a budget-setting and administering organization, separated from the armed services by a firewall that the United States finds hard to understand. The U.S. Defense Department is joined at the hip with the armed forces, and its ways are similarly opaque to Indian observers.The two sides must deepen the US-India dialogue on Pakistan, Afghanistan and the Middle East. 
The way forward: suggestions
The important parallels between Indian and US national interests will keep pushing the two countries forward, despite these challenges. It will occasionally be a rocky ride. Two recommendations could help the two countries come closer to the potential for this important relationship:
â€¢ The United States must show respect for India's standing as a nation whose civilization is still leaving its mark on the world, and whose commitment to strategic autonomy remains strong. This is the starting point for serious progress in any aspect of US-India relations. Successful US negotiators need to listen before delivering their talking points, and to understand India's priorities -- even if they do not share them. Grand public statements comparing US-India ties with NATO, for example, are likely to be read as a challenge to India's ability to set its own course.
â€¢ The two sides must deepen the US-India dialogue on Pakistan, Afghanistan and the Middle East. In the short term, the United States and India are unlikely to overcome their different perspectives on these regions. However, a serious dialogue, conducted with honesty and candour, can go a long way toward mitigating the ""dialogue of the deaf"" that all too often clouds their strategic conversation."
ABC News,America,,"Fearful amid attacks, visa changes, aspirational Indians rethink American dream","More Indians move to America for skilled employment than any other nationality. But a string of racially-motivated attacks ï¿½ spurred, some say, by anti-immigrant sentiment under President Donald Trump ï¿½ is prompting a rethink.
""Silicon Valley's a dream for many people, to go and work there,"" said 19-year-old Raghav Sarin, an economics student at New Delhi's Indian Institute of Technology.
""I hope to go there, somewhere, there's a lot of talent, a lot of good work there,"" he said.
But perhaps not right now.
""Its kind of scary, it's just a general feeling of fear,"" he said.
Following America's temporary ban on entrants from majority-Muslim nations, Indians in the United States have been targeted in a racially motivated attacks.
In February, two Indian engineers were shot in Kansas by a man who had questioned their legal status.
One died while the other and a good Samaritan who tried to stop the attacker were both wounded.
Last month, a Sikh man was shot and wounded in Washington state, by a masked attacker who then told his victim to ""go back to your own country"".
In India, outrage boiled.
Home Minister Rajnath Singh told Parliament, ""what has happened is extremely painful, unfortunate and can't be condemned enough"".
Opposition Congress MP Mallikharjun Kharge went further, linking the violence to the anti-immigration sentiment under Mr Trump despite, he said, the country's reputation for ""transparency, democracy and a lack of racial discrimination"".
""Such incidents have increased after the new US President has taken charge,"" Mr Kharge said.
Jobs in the balance
India's politicians however were measured in their criticism, as Mr Trump weighed the future of America's skilled immigration program.
Nearly a quarter of a million Indians, most of whom are tech graduates, apply each year for what are called H1-B visas ï¿½ similar to the now-defunct Australian 457.
And 70 per cent of the 85,000 visas go to Indians.
While campaigning, Mr Trump was heavily critical of the H1-B visa.
""It's very bad for business and it's very bad for our workers, and we should end it,"" he said.
This week, he instead announced plans to reform it, doing away with the lottery element and calling on several federal agencies for further ideas.
India's $200-billion-a-year tech sector is rattled ï¿½ companies like Infosys, Wipro and Tata consultancies are all expecting cuts to the number of workers they can take to America, hurting their competitiveness.
The National Association of Software and Service Companies (NASSCOM) which represents them is appealing to Mr Trump's business sense and Scottish heritage.
""Immigrants have been very successful,"" NASSCOM's vice-president Shivendra Singh said.
""You have dozens of examples in the US ï¿½ who've come in and run multi-billion-dollar companies.""
Among the success stories are Google's Indian-born CEO Sundar Pachai, and Microsoft boss Satya Nadella, both role models for subcontinental students who hope to make it in America.
Mr Nadella recently said his career was made possible by ""an enlightened [American] immigration policy"".
Still the land of opportunity?
But among the current generation of students, America's pre-eminence as a liberal minded destination for entrepreneurial talent is in now in question.
""I feel the whole thing of Silicon Valley as a melting pot ï¿½ a place for people to come from everywhere and really work ï¿½ I think that image is going to be tainted a bit,"" Mr Sarin said.
""Going to that place to fulfil our dreams, that is difficult,"" said PhD student Sucharita Sethy, also from Delhi's Indian Institute of Technology.
Sandeep Roy, now a Kolkata-based writer, spent 20 years living in America as a software engineer and writer before returning to India.
Mr Roy said the combination of racially-motivated violence and expectation of fewer work opportunities was reshaping Indians' impressions of America.
""The latest events have put a pause button on people's views of that golden American dream,"" he said.
""People start wondering, 'hmm, is it really worth the risk?'"" he said.
In addition to fearing the extreme violence, Mr Roy said, Indian friends in America were reporting an increase in what he termed ""garden-variety go-back-to-your-country"" type racism.
But he said he hoped there was a silver lining for India in the unease and declining opportunities abroad, pointing out that the rapidly-developing nation stood to benefit if more of its budding entrepreneurs chose to apply their talents at home."
The Guardian,Britain,,Why is India so bad for women?,"Of all the rich G20 nations, India has been labelled the worst place to be a woman. But how is this possible in a country that prides itself on being the world's largest democracy? In an ashram perched high on a hill above the noisy city of Guwahati in north-east India is a small exhibit commemorating the life of India's most famous son. Alongside an uncomfortable-looking divan where Mahatma Gandhi once slept is a display reminding visitors of something the man himself said in 1921: ""Of all the evils for which man has made himself responsible, none is so degrading, so shocking or so brutal as his abuse of the better half of humanity; the female sex (not the weaker sex).""
One evening two weeks ago, just a few miles downhill, a young student left a bar and was set upon by a gang of at least 18 men. They dragged her into the road by her hair, tried to rip off her clothes and smiled at the cameras that filmed it all. It was around 9.30pm on one of Guwahati's busiest streets ï¿½ a chaotic three-lane thoroughfare soundtracked by constantly beeping horns and chugging tuk-tuks. But for at least 20 minutes, no one called the police. They easily could have. Many of those present had phones: they were using them to film the scene as the men yanked up the girl's vest and tugged at her bra and groped her breasts as she begged for help from passing cars. We know this because a cameraman from the local TV channel was there too, capturing the attack for his viewers' enjoyment. The woman was abused for 45 minutes before the police arrived.

Within half an hour, clips were broadcast on Assam's NewsLive channel. Watching across town, Sheetal Sharma and Bitopi Dutta were horrified. ""I was fuming like anything. There was this horrible, brutal assault being shown on screen ï¿½ and the most disturbing thing was, the blame was being put on the woman, who, the report emphasised, was drunk,"" says Sharma, a 29-year-old feminist activist from the North-East Network, a women's rights organisation in Guwahati. ""The way it was filmed, the camera was panning up and down her body, focusing on her breasts, her thighs,"" says Dutta, her 22-year-old colleague.
When the police eventually turned up, they took away the woman, who is 20 or 21 (oddly, Guwahati police claimed not to know exactly). While NewsLive re-played pixellated footage of her attack throughout the night, she was questioned and given a medical examination. No attempt was made to arrest the men whose faces could clearly be seen laughing and jeering on camera. Soon afterwards, the editor-in-chief of NewsLive (who has since resigned) remarked on Twitter that ""prostitutes form a major chunk of girls who visit bars and night clubs"".
It was only a few days later, when the clip had gone viral and had been picked up by the national channels in Delhi, that the police were shamed into action. By then, Guwahati residents had taken matters into their own hands, producing an enormous banner that they strung up alongside one of the city's arterial roads featuring screen grabs of the main suspects. Six days after the attack, the chief minister of Assam, the state where Guwahati is located, ordered the police to arrest a dozen key suspects. He met the victim and promised her 50,000 rupees (ï¿½580) compensation.
The damage was already irreversible. Most Indians know full well how tough life as a woman can be in the world's biggest democracy, even 46 years after Indira Gandhi made history as the country's first female prime minister in 1966. But here, caught on camera, was proof. And in Assam ï¿½ a state long romanticised as the most female-friendly corner of the country, largely thanks to the matrilineal Khasi tribe in Meghalaya. The nation was outraged.

""We have a woman president, we've had a woman prime minister. Yet in 2012, one of the greatest tragedies in our country is that women are on their own when it comes to their own safety,"" said a female newsreader on NDTV. She went on to outline another incident in India last week: a group of village elders in Baghpat, Uttar Pradesh, central India, who banned women from carrying mobile phones, choosing their own husbands or leaving the house unaccompanied or with their heads uncovered. ""The story is the same,"" said the news anchor. ""No respect for women. No respect for our culture. And as far as the law is concerned: who cares?""
There is currently no special law in India against sexual assault or harassment, and only vaginal penetration by a penis counts as rape. Those who molested the woman in Guwahati would be booked for ""insulting or outraging the modesty of a woman"" or ""intruding upon her privacy"". The maximum punishment is a year's imprisonment, or a fine, or both.
As a columnist in the national Hindustan Times said of the attack: ""This is a story of a dangerous decline in Indians and India itself, of not just failing morality but disintegrating public governance when it comes to women."" Samar Halarnkar added: ""Men abuse women in every society, but few males do it with as much impunity, violence and regularity as the Indian male.""
Halarnkar then offered as proof a survey that caused indignation in India last month: a poll of 370 gender specialists around the world that voted India the worst place to be a woman out of all the G20 countries. It stung ï¿½ especially as Saudi Arabia was at the second-worst. But the experts were resolute in their choice. ""In India, women and girls continue to be sold as chattels, married off as young as 10, burned alive as a result of dowry-related disputes and young girls exploited and abused as domestic slave labour,"" said Gulshun Rehman, health programme development adviser at Save the Children UK, who was one of those polled.

Look at some statistics and suddenly the survey isn't so surprising. Sure, India might not be the worst place to be a woman on the planet ï¿½ its rape record isn't nearly as bad as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, for instance, where more than 400,000 women are raped each year, and female genital mutilation is not widespread, as it is in Somalia. But 45% of Indian girls are married before the age of 18, according to the International Centre for Research on Women (2010); 56,000 maternal deaths were recorded in 2010 (UN Population Fund) and research from Unicef in 2012 found that 52% of adolescent girls (and 57% of adolescent boys) think it is justifiable for a man to beat his wife. Plus crimes against women are on the increase: according to the National Crime Records Bureau in India, there was a 7.1% hike in recorded crimes against women between 2010 and 2011 (when there were 228,650 in total). The biggest leap was in cases under the ""dowry prohibition act"" (up 27.7%), of kidnapping and abduction (up 19.4% year on year) and rape (up 9.2%).
A preference for sons and fear of having to pay a dowry has resulted in 12 million girls being aborted over the past three decades, according to a 2011 study by the Lancet.
A glance at the Indian media reveals the range of abuse suffered by the nation's women on a daily basis. Today it was reported that a woman had been stripped and had her head shaved by villagers near Udaipur as punishment for an extramarital affair. Villagers stoned the police when they came to the rescue. In Uttar Pradesh, a woman alleged she was gang raped at a police station ï¿½ she claimed she was set on by officers after being lured to the Kushinagar station with the promise of a job.
Last Wednesday, a man in Indore was arrested for keeping his wife's genitals locked. Sohanlal Chouhan, 38, ""drilled holes"" on her body and, before he went to work each day, would insert a small lock, tucking the keys under his socks. Earlier this month, children were discovered near Bhopal playing with a female foetus they had mistaken for a doll in a bin. In the southern state of Karnataka, a dentist was arrested after his wife accused him of forcing her to drink his urine because she refused to meet dowry demands.
In June, a father beheaded his 20-year-old daughter with a sword in a village in Rajasthan, western India, parading her bleeding head around as a warning to other young women who might fall in love with a lower-caste boy.
This July, the state government in Delhi was summoned to the national high court after failing to amend an outdated law that exempts women (and turban-wearing Sikh men) from wearing helmets on motorcycles ï¿½ an exemption campaigners argue is indicative of the lack of respect for female life.
But the story that outraged most women in India last week was an interview given to the Indian Express by Mamta Sharma, chairwoman of the National Commission of Women (NCW), a government body tasked with protecting and promoting the interests of Indian women. Asked by the reporter if there should be a dress code for women ""to ensure their safety"", Sharma allegedly replied: ""After 64 years of freedom, it is not right to give blanket directions ... and say don't wear this or don't wear that. Be comfortable, but at the same time, be careful about how you dress ... Aping the west blindly is eroding our culture and causing such crimes to happen.""

She added: ""Westernisation has afflicted our cities the worst. There are no values left. In places like Delhi there is no culture of giving up seats for women. It is unfortunate that while the west is learning from our culture, we are giving ourselves up completely to western ways.""
Her remarks caused a storm. As Sagarika Ghose put it in the online magazine First Post: ""It's not just about blindly aping the west, Ms Sharma. It's also about the vacuum in the law, lack of security at leisure spots, lack of gender justice, lack of fear of the law, police and judicial apathy and the complete lack of awareness that men and women have the right to enjoy exactly the same kind of leisure activities.""
The Guardian asked Sharma for an interview to clarify her remarks but our requests were ignored.
Maini Mahanta, the editor of the Assamese women's magazine Nandini (""Daughter""), believes the NCW chair's remarks are indicative of what she calls the ""Taliban-plus"" mentality that is creeping into Indian society. ""In this part of the world, it's worse than the Taliban,"" she insists in her Guwahati office. ""At least the Taliban are open about what they like and dislike. Here, society is so hypocritical. We worship female goddesses and yet fail to protect women from these crimes and then blame them too.""

 Indian women, such as these three in Bawana, on the outskirts of Delhi, frequently come under pressure to abort female foetuses. 
Mahanta explains how traditions still cast women as helpless victims rather than free-thinking individuals in control of their own destiny. Girls still tie Raksha bandhan or ""safety ties"" around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their duty to protect them, she says. She complains, too, about the Manu Sanghita, an ancient Indian book that she claims preaches: ""When a girl is young, she is guided by her father; when she is older, she is guided by her husband; when she is very old, she is guided by her son."" She despairs of the cult of the ""good girl, who is taught to walk slowly 'like an elephant' and not laugh too loud"".

Even in Mumbai, India's most cosmopolitan city, women have been arrested and accused of being prostitutes when drinking in the city's bars.
Sheetal Sharma and Bitopi Dutta, the young feminists from the North East Network, complain that modern women are divided into ""bad"" and ""good"" according to what they wear, whether they go out after dark and whether they drink alcohol. ""We are seeing a rise of moral policing, which blames those women who are not seen as being 'good',"" says Sharma. ""So if they are abused in a pub, for example, it's OK ï¿½ they have to learn their lesson,"" adds Dutta, 22, who grumbles that young women such as herself cannot now hold hands with a boyfriend in a Guwahati park, let alone kiss, without getting into trouble with the moral police, if not the real police.
Many women agree the response from the Guwahati authorities shows they are blind to the root cause: a society that does not truly respect women. Instead, a knee-jerk reaction was taken to force all bars and off-licences to shut by 9.30pm. Club Mint, the bar outside which the young woman was molested, had its licence revoked. Parents were urged to keep a close eye on their daughters.
Zabeen Ahmed, the 50-year-old librarian at Cotton College in Guwahati, tells how she was out for an evening walk not long ago when she was stopped by the police. ""They asked me what I was doing out at that at that time ï¿½ it was 10.30pm or so ï¿½ and they asked me where my husband was.""
The fact that India has a female president ï¿½ Pratibha Patil ï¿½ and Sonia Gandhi in control of the ruling Congress party means very little, insists Monisha Behal, ""chairperson"" of the North East Network. ""In the UK, you have had Margaret Thatcher ï¿½ if you are being harassed by a hoodlum in the street there, do ask: 'How can this be when we have had a woman prime minister?'"" she says.
Every Indian woman the Guardian spoke to for this article agreed that harassment was part of their everyday lives. Mahanta revealed that she always carries chilli powder in her handbag if she ever has to take public transport and needed to throw it in the face of anyone with wandering hands. Deepika Patar, 24, a journalist at the Seven Sisters newspaper in Assam, says city buses were notorious for gropers. ""If women are standing up because there are no seats, men often press up against them, or touch their breasts or bottom,"" she explains.
In June, an anonymous Delhi woman wrote a powerful blog post detailing what happened when she dared not to travel in the ""ladies carriage"" of Delhi's modern metro. After asking a man not to stand too close to her, things turned nasty. Another man intervened and told the first to back off, but soon the two were having a bloody fight in the train carriage. Rather than break up the brawl, the other passengers turned on the woman, shouting: ""This is all your fault. You started this fight. This is all because you came into this coach!"" and ""You women always do this. You started this fight!"" and ""Why are you even here? Go to the women's coach.""
Speaking under condition of anonymity, the 35-year-old blogger says she had experienced sexual harassment ""tonnes of times"". ""I hate to use the word, but I'm afraid it has become 'normal',"" she says. ""Like if you're in a lift, men will press up against you or grab you or make a comment about your appearance. It's because of this that I stopped travelling by buses and started travelling by auto rickshaws, and eventually got a car myself ï¿½ to avoid this ordeal. When the metro was launched I loved it ï¿½ it's an improvement in public transport, very well maintained, you feel safe. Then this happened and I was blamed.""

By Thursday last week, the Guwahati molestation case had become even murkier. Police had arrested and charged 12 men with ""outraging the public decency of a woman"", and on Friday they charged journalist Gaurav Jyoti Neog of NewsLive with instigating the attack he filmed. Neog denies orchestrating the attack or taking any part in it, apart from filming it ""so that the perpetrators can be nabbed"". But police have forced him to give a voice sample, which has been sent to a forensic laboratory for analysis, to compare with the footage. The verdict is out on that case, but one thing is clear: 91 years after Gandhi urged Indian men to treat their women with respect, the lesson has yet to be learned."
The Guardian,Britain,,"Obama feted in Delhi as US cements closer ties with India 
","President uses attendance at Republic Day celebrations to woo Narendra Modi as part of USï¿½s security rebalancing towards Asia. The first American president to attend Indiaï¿½s Republic Day celebrations was greeted by an array of Russian weaponry on Monday as the lengthy martial parade underscored how far the US has to go in its efforts to become Delhiï¿½s preferred new military partner.
Just one day after agreeing an ambitious defence co-operation agreement with the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, Barack Obama arrived in the pouring rain as a fly-by of Russian-made Mil helicopters heralded a two-hour procession led by cold war-era tanks and armoured personnel carriers.
White House officials insisted the president was not offended by the overt reminder of Indiaï¿½s historic alliance with the Soviet Union and said the presidentï¿½s trip to Delhi was a crucial part its security rebalancing towards Asia.
ï¿½The US is quickly moving toward surpassing Russia as a defence exporter to India,ï¿½ the deputy national security adviser, Ben Rhodes, told reporters. ï¿½The balance has shifted over years and our relationship is on the upswing even though we understand there is a legacy relationship. That cold war relationship has been a source of mistrust but we are moving beyond that.ï¿½

Parade announcers made sure to stress the pedigree of the only US equipment on display ï¿½ a C-17 and three C-130 transport planes. Many of the floats and equipment on show were also of domestic origin: from representatives of Indiaï¿½s booming space programme, through to a military band riding on camels.

American officials also denied it was inappropriate for Obama, a Nobel peace prize recipient, to be endorsing such a overt display of military muscle in a region known for growing security tensions.

ï¿½Lots of countries have military parades but what the president is comfortable with is this is a democracy,ï¿½ said Rhodes.
Nonetheless, Obamaï¿½s attempt to cement close military links with Modi has not gone unnoticed in China, where state media on Monday sought to play down its significance.
ï¿½Itï¿½s noticeable that they should feel they have to go out of their way to comment on this visit,ï¿½ added Rhodes. ï¿½No one is looking to confront or contain China, but the US and India are committed to a rules-based system, so, for example, if there are maritime disputes we want them resolved peacefully in line with the law.ï¿½

The US is seeking to distinguish India from Russia and China by stressing its history as a democracy with similar values ï¿½ something Obamaï¿½s presence at the Republic Day celebration was designed to underline.


Though Indian and international media focused on Obamaï¿½s presence, the primary audience was a domestic one. Tens of thousands braved weather that, by Delhi standards, was unseasonably cold. Streets were empty in much of the capital.
The Republic Day parade celebrates the introduction in 1950 of the countryï¿½s own constitution and thus its full independence from Britain. Its theme this year was described by officials as ï¿½womenï¿½s empowermentï¿½. India has been hit by a surge of violence towards women in recent years, including several high-profile sexual assaults. Selective abortion according to gender is a major issue and women face widespread discrimination.
ï¿½The parade was awesome as always but the lady soldiers were really good, and the jet planes at the end too. We are showing Mr Obama our culture and traditions,ï¿½ said Shubhangi Tyagi, a 19-year-old student at Delhi University.
However, experts said the unprecedented role played by women in the parade may have been more symbolic than substantive.
ï¿½Thereï¿½s been no move so far towards allowing women to hold permanent commissions [as officers] nor allow them into combat arms such as infantry or the armoured corps,ï¿½ said Ajai Shukla, a former army officer and defence analyst.


Also noticeable was the absence of intercontinental ballistic missiles, given pride of place in many previous parades.
ï¿½Whether the idea was to make the parade less militarised and focus more attention on floats with dancers and so on, or whether it was to cater to US sensibilities is unclear,ï¿½ said Shukla.
Before the parade, gallantry medals were awarded posthumously to two soldiers killed last year in clashes with Islamist separatists in the Himalayan former princedom of Kashmir, disputed for more than six decades years by India and Pakistan.
After the tanks, weapons and marching contingents, with female officers in the foreground for the first time, came the carnivalesque floats representing Indian states and key government projects. These included elements bearing the stamp of Modiï¿½s own vision.
A float from the 64-year-oldï¿½s home state of Gujarat, where he was chief minister between 2002 and 2014, showcased a project to raise a gigantic statue of Vallabhbhai Patel, the statesman who unified Indiaï¿½s patchwork of territories following independence from Britain.
Gujarat-born Patel is revered by many Indian nationalists, who often contrast him with Jawaharlal Nehru, the independence leader who is an icon of the centre-left Congress party, which has held power for most of the countryï¿½s history but is now in opposition. ï¿½Patel is seen [by rightwingers] as a hard-headed realist, rather than the woolly-headed idealist Nehru. He was also disowned by Congress,ï¿½ said Ramachandra Guha, one of Indiaï¿½s foremost political historians.
The 29,890m-rupee (ï¿½315m) statue will stand 182 metres tall, twice the height of the Statue of Liberty, and has been criticised by environmentalists.
Next came a float bearing a mechanised lion against ï¿½a background of a smart cityï¿½, according to the announcer. A screen on the float displaying the words ï¿½components, aviation, biotechnologyï¿½ made it clear that this represented Modiï¿½s vision of a powerful Indian economy based on manufacturing. Though picking up steadily, growth rates in the emerging power remain well below the previous peak of 9%, at about 5% for this year.
Then came a float showcasing a new ministry created to promote traditional India medicine and yoga. Other floats included one promoting the prime ministerï¿½s ï¿½Save your daughters, educate your daughtersï¿½ campaign. Some time later came a high-speed bullet train, a pet project of Modi who hopes to modernise Indiaï¿½s creaking, over-crowded railway network.
Ashok Sinha, a 57-year-old teacher from west Bengal, was among tens of thousands of spectators. ï¿½It is the best time in India ever. Big powers are respecting us and we are respecting them,ï¿½ Sinha said.
Though diplomats and commentators referred repeatedly to India and the US as natural allies, relations have never been straightforward between the worldï¿½s biggest democracies.

During the cold war, India tilted towards Moscow and the US towards Pakistan. More recently, the US placed India under sanctions following a nuclear test in 1998. Modi himself was denied a visa to the US under a law barring entry to foreigners who have committed ï¿½particularly severe violations of religious freedomï¿½.
The decision followed accusations that the former rightwing organiser had stood by during, or even encouraged, sectarian violence in the western state of Gujarat in 2002, when he was chief minister. More than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, were killed by rioters.
Modi has denied all wrongdoing and Indiaï¿½s supreme court ruled that there was insufficient evidence to back the charges against him.
The relationship reached a nadir when the Indian deputy consul-general in the US was arrested for visa fraud in New York in December 2013. The affair prompted a vitriolic reaction in India to what was seen as disrespectful bullying. This in turn prompted US commentators to accuse India of oversensitivity and behaviour unbecoming of an aspirant future power.
Modi won the first outright majority in Indian politics for 30 years in the poll last May after pledging to boost flagging growth in the emerging power where red tape, corruption, poor infrastructure and restrictive laws remain major challenges to business. He swiftly accepted an invitation from Obama to visit following his win.
Sahil Khatrapal, 25, had been tasked with ensuring the supply of gas to the flame of the martyrï¿½s memorial during the wreath-laying ceremony before the parade.
ï¿½I was very proud to be a citizen of India. Right from the time the national anthem played at the start, to when it plays at the end,ï¿½ he said."
The Guardian,Britain,,"As the US moves closer to India, Pakistan looks to Russia ","Islamabadï¿½s military and political leaders are seeking to warm ties with Moscow that have been frosty since the cold war . As the US forges closer ties to India, neighbouring Pakistan is looking for some new friends. Officials hope they have found one in Russia ï¿½ a budding partnership that could eventually shift historic alliances in south Asia.
In recent months, Pakistani military and political leaders have reached out to Moscow, seeking to warm ties that have been frosty since the cold war. In November, Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu visited Islamabad and signed a military cooperation agreement with Pakistani generals. Pakistan now hopes to finalise plans to buy three dozen Russian Mi-35 helicopters and more closely coordinate efforts to counter terrorism and narcotics. Pakistan also wants Russian assistance to stabilise chronic energy shortages.
The moves come as Pakistani leaders grow increasingly nervous that their traditional alliances could erode, if not crumble, in the coming years. For much of its history, Pakistan has been an ally of the US, while Russia had stronger ties to India, even backing it during that countryï¿½s 1971 war with Pakistan. But now that most Nato troops have left next-door Afghanistan ï¿½ and the Pakistani army is straining to overcome Islamist militants on its western border ï¿½ officials fear that the USï¿½s regional interest is tilting toward India, Pakistanï¿½s eastern neighbour and arch-rival.
ï¿½Of course we are concerned,ï¿½ said one senior Pakistani military leader, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ï¿½The balance of power is being tipped toward India, and that is not good, and itï¿½s been done with the help of the western world. That is why we are looking at various markets, because conventional [military] parity is the only recipe for peace and stability.ï¿½

Pakistanï¿½s efforts to kindle ties with Moscow come as relations between the west and Russia continue to worsen, which may prompt it to look for new trading partners in Asia. Pakistanis are also worried the Indian army is moving toward dominance in the conventional arms race.
Those concerns were magnified last month, when US President Barack Obama met in Delhi with Indian prime minister Narendra Modi. Obama and Modi vowed to strengthen cooperation on defence and energy matters, and they announced a deal that they said should smooth the way for American companies to invest in Indian civilian nuclear plants.
Since Pakistan was partitioned from India in 1947, the two nuclear-armed countries have fought three major wars. So when Obama was the guest of honour at an elaborate military parade in Delhi, it was viewed with scepticism.
ï¿½To be very honest, we think Obama has gone one step too far,ï¿½ said Maria Sultan, chairwoman of the Islamabad-based South Asian Strategic Stability Institute, an organisation with close links to Pakistani military and intelligence.

In another sign of the unease, Pakistanï¿½s powerful army chief, Raheel Sharif, travelled to China last month to solidify long-standing military and economic ties between the two countries. China is Pakistanï¿½s largest arms supplier, having sold or transferred it nearly $4bn in weapons since 2006, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri), which monitors arms sales.

The US, with about $2.5bn in arms sales to Pakistan over the past nine years, is the countryï¿½s second-largest arms supplier. In December, Congress also authorised $1bn in additional funds to Pakistan for its continued support of counter-terrorism operations. But it is unclear how much American aid will flow to Pakistan in the coming years.
Tasnim Aslam, spokeswoman for Pakistanï¿½s ministry of foreign affairs, said Pakistan doesnï¿½t want to ï¿½put all of its eggs in one basketï¿½.
ï¿½Itï¿½s a multi-polar world, and itï¿½s in our interest to engage all the poles and forge relationships,ï¿½ said Aslam, who last month led a high-level Pakistani delegation to Moscow to discuss future ties.
Noting secretary of state John Kerry had a productive visit to Islamabad last month, Aslam said Washington shouldnï¿½t read too much into Pakistanï¿½s outreach to Vladimir Putin. But some Pakistani lawmakers offered a more pointed view of Pakistanï¿½s rapprochement with Russia.
ï¿½Pakistanï¿½s historical mistake after its inception was to establish close ties with the United States but to ignore the Russians,ï¿½ said Haji Muhammad Adeel, a lawmaker who chairs the Pakistani senateï¿½s foreign relations committee. ï¿½We went to war with Russia in Afghanistan, and that brought us gifts of terrorism, extremism and drugs. Now Pakistan is trying to forge friendly ties with Russia to correct the mistakes of past.ï¿½
Despite that outreach, it remains unclear whether Pakistanï¿½s efforts to bolster ties with Russia will pay off.
Russian diplomats in Islamabad declined to comment on the two countriesï¿½ relations. But Russia is Indiaï¿½s largest arms supplier, with $18bn in sales since 2006, according to Sipri.
Yury Barmin, a Russian foreign policy expert based in the United Arab Emirates, said he doubts Russia would risk its relationship with India by also selling arms to Pakistan. He said he suspects Putin, who visited Delhi in December, is using Pakistan as leverage over the Indian government so it doesnï¿½t get too close to the US.
ï¿½Itï¿½s the way Russian diplomacy works,ï¿½ Barmin said. ï¿½They find a pressure point, but then they go to India and release the pressure and say, ï¿½Hey, we are not developing that relationship any more.ï¿½ï¿½
But Rifaat Hussain, an Islamabad-based defence expert, said the west should not underestimate the potential for a realignment of strategic ties in Asia.
ï¿½There is now a visible strain with Moscowï¿½s relationship with the United States, and Moscow has moved much closer to China, which I think facilitates Pakistanï¿½s relationship with Russia,ï¿½ Hussain said."
Huffington Post,America,,The Trump Presidency And The Future Of Indo-US Relations,"Less than three months into Donald Trumpï¿½s tenure as President of the United States, Indian observers are contemplating the future of bilateral relations with the global leader, not to mention the regional implications of the new administration. Questions arise whether to take Mr Trumpï¿½s ï¿½America Firstï¿½ rhetoric seriously, or to believe that dealing with a businessman persona will ultimately benefit Indiaï¿½s diplomats, businesses, and citizens. 
Taking into account such uncertainty and what weï¿½ve seen of Mr. Trump and his team thus far, the path forward for India in key geo-economics and geopolitical areas is fraught with challenges. Nevertheless, India has an opportunity to expand and deepen its trade relations, upgrade its domestic capacity, move forward with climate change action, and become a leader in the Asia-Pacific region.
Therefore, India must design and implement a clear, internally-based strategy through an inclusive process to promote open and fair trade and cooperation bilaterally, regionally, and multilaterally. 
Relations between the US and India will likely remain constant for some time, and hopefully even continue the positive movement made under the past two presidencies. The Trump Presidency will have less of a direct impact on India, barring a few critical areas like movement of Indian professionals to the United States or impediments to foreign direct investment (FDI) into India. 
Although no less important, the Trump administration - guided by an ï¿½America Firstï¿½ strategy that emphasizes transactionalism - is likely to create more indirect impact in terms of trade, climate change, and regional integration. Importantly, the bilateral relationship is expected to be dictated chiefly by business considerations and less by shared values or cultural connections; something for Indian representatives to consider when trying to maintain progress in Indo-US relations. 
Despite the Trump administration positioning itself for greater bilateral trade agreements - of which India must certainly take advantage - India should broaden its gaze with regard to trade as a tool for meeting economic and development goals in order to weather this storm of uncertainty. The UK, Canada, and Peru as well as economic communities in Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Central Asia are top potential trading partners. Also, completing current negotiations with the EU, Australia, and especially the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership agreement will be vital for India to broaden its market access while upgrading its trading standards and capacity. Indiaï¿½s recent accession to the Customs Convention on International Transport of Goods is a welcomed step toward efficient multi-modal movement of goods. 
Considering the fervent populism seen in many parts of the world, a country like India that has gained much from its stance on open trade will have to make even greater efforts to listen to its people at all levels when implementing trade policy - particularly from those most vulnerable to trade liberalization. This will also require clear and targeted domestic provisions for retraining, relocation, and unemployment support.
As Mr. Trumpï¿½s ï¿½America Firstï¿½ position moves into action at the executive and legislative level, restrictions on temporary work visas could severely impact Indiaï¿½s employment and remittances as well as hamper diplomatic ties between the two countries. Increasing that threat is Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a long-time critic of such visas. Immigration restrictions could also negatively affect the US economy, as Indian IT companies contributed $22.5 billion in US taxes annually and $6.6 billion in Social Security from 2011-2015. They also invested $2 billion into the United States from 2011-2013, and continue to provide thousands of US-based jobs. The United States will sorely need such contributions from India considering that by 2022 it is projected to have a skilled labor shortfall of 17 million, whereas India will have a surplus.

 
India and its industries must unequivocally show the US administration that its skilled and unskilled jobs - the kinds of jobs Mr. Trump has called to return home - cannot be filled with domestic labor alone; blocking Indian professionals out of the US labor market will only exacerbate the labor shortage. Indiaï¿½s numerous allies in Congress will be essential in this effort. Concomitantly, Indian skilled labor must elevate itself from dependency on the US by connecting with other markets to provide services in IT, banking, and finance, as well as growing retail and healthcare services. 
As relations between the United States and China remain unpredictable, India will have to play the balancing act, not unlike with recent US and Russian relations. India should not expect that the potential rise in tension between the U.S. and China will draw Washington closer to Delhi, considering Mr. Trumpï¿½s transactional worldview. Likewise, India should not become complacent in thinking that its friendship will blossom due to Mr. Trumpï¿½s global tirades against what he sees as his enemies. Rather, India must cultivate relationships with both countries based on its own principles and strategic vision.
With the potential of US disengagement in the global movement to tackle climate change looming, India has the opportunity to be a driver in the green industry, considering the advancements and accessibility of renewable technology. While financing will be a challenge if the US breaks from its commitments, India can gain a foothold on becoming a leader in renewable technology by first promoting its intrinsic aggregator industry to develop solar technology. Such groups of aggregators, with established supply links in compatible sectors such as electronics, can procure components domestically and internationally more efficiently than multinational brick and mortar solar companies. In the long-run, of course, India must invest in start-ups of the renewables industry.
As regional leadership gaps arise with the potential US withdrawal, whether in economic integration or climate change, India should advance itself diplomatically as a cooperative partner with a history of understanding and promoting the needs of developing countries in the region. Historical US allies such as South Korea, Japan, and more recently Vietnam can look to India as a strong partner in the region on trade and economic integration; both bilaterally and in regional arrangements. 
To whatever extent the Trump Administrationï¿½s ï¿½America Firstï¿½ policy regime may or may not challenge Indo-US relations, Indiaï¿½s core focus must remain on promoting mutually beneficial trade arrangements and cooperation bilaterally, regionally, and multilaterally. The unnerving lack of predictability from the United States should not invite reactionary approaches from the Indian government, businesses, or citizenry. If India is guided by grounded principles based in its development and economic needs, it can surely weather any storm of uncertainty that may come its way."
Fox News,America,,"America must stand up for persecuted Christians in Saudi Arabia, India and around the world","Targeted attacks on Christians are increasing in parts of the world where they are the minority faith ï¿½ including long-time U.S. allies India and Saudi Arabia, whose Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman met with President Trump on Tuesday at the White House.
While most Americans are understandably focused on news about developments in our own country, itï¿½s critically important that we pay attention to this growing anti-Christian persecution abroad.
Just as he has met with the Saudi crown prince, President Trump met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in Manila last November. The presidentï¿½s press secretary reported that their meeting discussed ï¿½the comprehensive strategic partnership between the United States and India, and their shared commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific region.ï¿½
We cooperate with Saudi Arabia and India, as well at others, despite the fact they are the places where Christians are being persecuted. Of the 50 countries where Christians are most persecuted today, as noted in the 2018 Open Doors World Watch List, India is No. 11 and Saudi Arabia is No. 12.
Itï¿½s time for people of faith in this country to let their interest in human rights shine a light on Christians facing persecution in every part of the world. Yes, persecution will always exist, but the Bible calls us to support our brothers and sisters as they face these challenges.
In India, for example, a variety of radical Hindu groups ï¿½ including the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) ï¿½ are responsible for persecuting Christians. Christians are seen as outsiders and traitors to the native culture. The BJP and RSS have announced their intent to cleanse the nation of both Islam and Christianity.
M.S. Golwalker, founder of the RSS, is seeking to unite Indiaï¿½s population into one Hindu nation. Non-Hindu people, he announced, must be ï¿½wholly subordinated to the Hindu nation, claiming nothing, deserving no privileges, far less any preferential treatment ï¿½ not even citizenï¿½s rights.ï¿½
Persecution in Saudi Arabia is built on a rigid interpretation of Islam. The government maintains a tightly knit Islamic system that treats Christians as second-class citizens. Culturally, Christians are seen as infidels, and apostasy is punishable by penalties as severe as death.
So why arenï¿½t Christians speaking up? Why isnï¿½t there a movement of Christians rising up to defend their suffering brothers and sisters in other countries who risk their lives to follow Jesus?
It may come down to bad theology. Some pastors preach that persecution will always be present ï¿½ an observation that can be supported by Scriptures like 1 Peter 4:12, which warn believers not to be surprised by trials that arise, but to rejoice in sharing in Christï¿½s suffering. These sermons sometimes present a one-dimensional view of persecution, as if it is part of the unchangeable nature of the world.
But in packaging persecution this way, these theological positions often fail to emphasize how Christians are called to respond to the needs of our brothers and sisters.
Hebrews, for example, talks about the need to ï¿½care for those in chains for the name of Jesus.ï¿½ Galatians instructs Christians to ï¿½bear one anotherï¿½s burdens.ï¿½ 1 Thessalonians commands believers to ï¿½encourage on another.ï¿½
Yet very few American Christians see it as part of their faith to challenge persecution.
Given the outrage Americans express over discrimination in our own country, our apathetic reaction to persecution abroad feels ironically weak. After all, our attention to human rights has dramatically increased in America since the civil rights movement. And thankfully, as a result, widespread efforts continue to confront and work against the sexism and racism that impact our society today.
In the U.S., government and watchdog agencies monitor the conditions in our workplaces, schools and communities to ensure everyone is granted the same rights. Religious discrimination is illegal ï¿½ as it should be around the world.
Some days, our interest in rights absorbs nearly every interaction we have. In some places, itï¿½s even seen as a human rights violation for Christians to share their faith with others in their networks. Donï¿½t violate someone elseï¿½s rights by forcing your beliefs on them.
Yet few speak up when Christians across oceans are being discriminated against, attacked, raped, imprisoned and even killed in rights violations far more severe than the verbal critiques mentioned above.
Itï¿½s time for people of faith in this country to let their interest in human rights shine a light on Christians facing persecution in every part of the world. Yes, persecution will always exist, but the Bible calls us to support our brothers and sisters as they face these challenges.
Given the current circumstances, now is the time to write, email or call your members of the U.S. House and Senate and let them know the American people care more about human rights violations in India than lucrative trade deals. Insist that any future defense or business partnerships must include provisions that protect religious minorities in India.
And if India is not committed to protecting the rights of all its citizens, regardless of their worship practices, then demand our government representatives re-examine the close relationship between India and the United States.
Similarly, Americans can ask their government officials to hold Saudi Arabiaï¿½s crown prince accountable for recent ï¿½shock reformsï¿½ in his country. Although the prince insists his actions are improving Saudi society, the severity of an anti-corruption crackdown ï¿½ where he ousted his cousin from power at the end of 2017 ï¿½ raises important questions.
There continues to be a need for political pressure to both address human rights concerns and limit executive powers in Saudi Arabia going forward. President Trump should withhold support from the Saudis unless standards are put into place to protect the rights of all that nationï¿½s residents, regardless of political or religious affiliation.
We can do better. Press for extended freedom of religion for the people of India and Saudi Arabia today."
Fox News,America,Washington,"Trump and Modi exchange hugs, herald stronger US-India ties","Hugging outside the White House Monday, President Donald Trump and India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi heralded an increasingly close strategic partnership as the U.S. branded a top militant from neighboring Pakistan as a ""global terrorist.""
Trump declared he was ""true friend"" of India and said relations between the two largest democracies have never been better. But there were some tensions in the inaugural meeting between the two populist leaders. On trade, Trump demanded fewer barriers for American companies exporting to India.
Speaking in the Rose Garden after their talks, Trump said: ""Both our nations have been struck by the evils of terrorism, and we are both determined to destroy terrorist organizations and the radical ideology that drives them. We will destroy radical Islamic terrorism.""
Modi, a Hindu nationalist but also leader of a nation with nearly 175 million Muslims, did not use the same, charged terminology. He stressed the importance of ""doing away"" with terrorist sanctuaries and safe havens, apparently reflecting Indian concerns about militants based in Pakistan, India's historical archrival. He said the U.S. and India will enhance intelligence-sharing.
Hours before Modi's arrival, the State Department imposed sanctions on Syed Salahuddin, the Pakistan-based leader of Hizbul Mujahideen, the main rebel group that fights against Indian control in the divided Himalayan region of Kashmir. India's foreign ministry hailed the move.
Trump has so far focused on outreach to China, India's other strategic rival, as he looks to Beijing to rein in nuclear-armed North Korea. But Washington and New Delhi share concerns about China's rise as a military power that have underpinned increasingly close relations in the past decade.
The Trump administration says it want to provide India with improved defense technology. The State Department on Monday approved the $365 million sale of a C-17 military transport aircraft to India. The administration is also set to offer a $2 billion sale of U.S.-made unarmed drones to help in surveillance of the Indian Ocean.
Although Modi's two-day Washington visit, which began Sunday, is lower-key than his previous three trips to the U.S. since he took office in 2014, it has included plenty of face-time with Trump. Modi later joined the president and first lady for dinner ï¿½ the first dinner Trump has hosted for a foreign dignitary at the White House, although he has hosted the leaders of Japan and China at his resort in Florida.
Trump and Modi share a populist streak and a knack for social media, but their economic nationalist agendas could clash. While Trump champions the idea of ""America First"" and wants to stop the migration of jobs overseas, Modi has his own drive to boost manufacturing at home, dubbed ""Make in India.""
India is among the nations singled out by the Trump administration for their trade surpluses with the U.S., and it is also reviewing a visa program used heavily by skilled Indian workers. The U.S. deficit in goods and services with India last year was about $30 billion.
""It is important that barriers be removed to the export of U.S. goods into your markets, and that we reduce our trade deficit with your country,"" Trump said.
But Trump also lauded Modi's economic stewardship, and the praise was mutual. Modi, who invited the president and his family to visit India, extolled Trump's leadership qualities. He said the president's ""vast and successful experience in the business world will lend an aggressive and forward-looking agenda to our relations.""
The personal chemistry between the two leaders could prove as important as policy in setting the tone for the future. They appeared keen to show they got along ï¿½ hugging twice during their joint appearance. They did not take questions.
When it comes to terrorism, Michael Kugelman, a South Asia expert at the Wilson Center, said the two leaders have a similar worldview ï¿½ that ""it needs to be destroyed wherever it rears its murderous head.""
He said the designation of Salahuddin shows that Washington is willing to work closely with New Delhi on terrorism-related matters, although it remains to be seen if that signals a tougher policy toward Pakistan. India accuses Pakistan-based militants of launching attacks on its soil.
The two leaders voiced a joint interest in bringing stability to Afghanistan, where India has committed $3 billion in aid since 2001. However, in their public remarks, they skirted the contentious issue of climate change. New Delhi has been irked by Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris accord."
CNN,America,,Trump's support of India could have unintended consequences,"Quietly, all but unheralded, Donald Trump has begun tilting significantly away from Pakistan and toward another South Asian ally -- a counterweight to China that could help tip the balance, particularly in the region's potentially most sensitive flashpoint, the South China Sea. That enemy of my enemy is India, and it is not an inconsiderable friend to have. At the same time, though, Trump's actions have opened another door to a resurgent China that could prove even more dangerous down the road. 
So, when did this relationship with India develop? The United States and India have been allies for a while, but Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi have significantly strengthened their bonds over the few months. Modi visited Trump in Washington last June, kicking off a new set of talks between the nations. And then at November's ASEAN Regional Forum in Manila, Philippines, the two leaders resolved to strengthen the US-India defense partnership, discussed expanding Indian oil imports from the United States to help shrink the trade gap and agreed to expand a supply line to Afghanistan that India was developing. 


Trump hasn't caused an international crisis yet, but we might not be so lucky in 2018
All this plays to India's advantage. India is hoping to find a big-power ally that can help it become a viable force against China, while at the same time maintaining security of its sea routes to the east. After all, more than two-thirds of India's entire trade volume arrives and departs by sea. 

India's new ""Look East Policy"" involves not only bulking up its blue water naval capability but also launching a new intercontinental ballistic missile that puts all of China within range of attack. China is not taking this news well. China has been concerned for a while with India's surging economic growth, military reach and population expansion. This new policy only irritates China more. 
To complicate matters, India's growth is surging at the very moment that China's is beginning to plateau. Last month, the International Monetary Fund revised Asia's economic growth upward largely on the strength of India's performance -- projecting an expansion in India of 7.5% this year and 7.8% next year, an increase over the 6.7% growth registered in 2017. By contrast, China is heading in the other direction -- its growth dropping from 6.8% last year to 6.6% this year and 6.4% next year. 



Trump has replaced old international allies with new ones
And there is no suggestion that the United States is prepared to squeeze India's foreign trade as it has already shown an inclination to take on leading Chinese exports, raising tariffs substantially on solar panels and washing machines. Of course, American two-way trade with India is a fraction of the trade with China, but it has been rising rapidly and the Indian government has been receptive to the Trump administration's pressure to reduce the size of its trade deficit. 
Most smaller Southeast Asian nations are also eager to see a newly resurgent India as a trade partner, but especially as a reliable balance to China, which has loomed over the region militarily as well as economically. 
In this respect, India is very much flexing its muscles. Last month, India successfully test fired an intercontinental ballistic missile with a range of 3,400 to 3,600 miles. It's also looking to double its fleet of 12 state-of-the-art American made P-81 anti-submarine patrol aircraft, able to detect submarine activity from the air. This comes just as China has offered India's neighbors -- Bangladesh, Thailand and especially Pakistan -- advanced Yuan class submarines at a fraction of the price of European or American models. 


Trump's unfair attack on Pakistan
In its nuclear arsenal, India already is believed to have 120 to 130 nuclear warheads, compared with China's 270, according to the Federation of American Scientists. Building a deliverable nuclear capacity has been a vital concern to India, until recently as a deterrent to the nation it has long seen as its mortal enemy: Pakistan, with 130 to 140 nuclear weapons. Which makes the current strategic situation in the region especially fraught, because both nations are believed to be bulking up their arsenals still further. 
This confrontation comes at the very moment the Trump administration has entered into a bitter war of words with Pakistan, once a loyal South Asian nation. As he has done in other parts of the world, notably the Middle East, where the President has thrown America's support firmly to Saudi Arabia, last month Trump announced that he was withholding some $2 billion of security aid from Pakistan as punishment for the regime allegedly harboring terrorists who are actively working to further destabilize Afghanistan. 
Not surprisingly, the Pakistani government has begun actively seeking new strategic partners. And, according to Chinese state-owned media, China has eagerly stepped in to assist. Already, China has investments and loans in Pakistan surpassing $100 billion. China has also, as CNN reported, made a major move into India's offshore neighbor, Sri Lanka, with a 99-year lease on a major port facility and some $15 billion in investments. 

All this has led a number of Asian nations, already skeptical of Trump after his withdrawal from the Trans Pacific Partnership, wondering how committed the United States is to providing a counterweight to Chinese hegemony across the region. While India could eventually prove to be such a counterweight, China has a significant head start.
Somehow, the United States has to find a way of choosing its friends more judiciously. It must also appreciate the consequences of choosing sides in a complex diplomatic and military game. At this point, though, the administration seems to have little understanding of the rules of the game, let alone the stakes involved."
The New York Times,America,,Modiï¿½s Long Silence as Women in India Are Attacked,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India tweets frequently and considers himself a talented orator. Yet he loses his voice when it comes to speaking out about the dangers faced by women and minorities who are frequent targets of the nationalist and communal forces that are part of the base of his Bharatiya Janata Party.
Indians took to the streets during the weekend to protest their governmentï¿½s callous response to the horrifying rape and murder of an 8-year-old girl in January in which supporters of his political party have been implicated. Mr. Modi, though, has barely spoken about this crime and other cases involving his supporters.
Until last week, he declined to address the attack on the girl, in the northern state of Jammu and Kashmir, by men who wanted to frighten and drive away her nomadic Muslim community, the Bakarwals, from an area that is dominated by Hindus. To read about what happened to the girl, who was held and abused at a Hindu temple, over several days is to plumb the depths of human depravity.
As Mr. Modi remained quiet as public outrage built up for weeks, state lawmakers from his party, which is part of a coalition that governs Jammu and Kashmir, attended a rally in support of a man who had been arrested for the crime and joined in demands by locals that the investigation be taken away from state officials, some of whom are Muslim, and be turned over to federal authorities. After a mob of Hindu lawyers temporarily prevented the authorities from registering charges in court, officials have formally accused eight men, including policemen and a retired government employee.


Mr. Modi has also been reluctant to talk about a rape accusation against a state lawmaker from his party in Indiaï¿½s most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, which is governed by the B.J.P. A teenage girl says the lawmaker raped her last summer, but until recently the police have dragged their feet in bringing charges against him. He and his brother are also accused of conspiring to kill the girlï¿½s father, who was found dead in police custody.


On Friday, Mr. Modi said that these cases had brought shame on the country and that ï¿½our daughters will definitely get justice.ï¿½ But his remarks ring hollow because he waited so long to talk about the cases and spoke in broad generalities ï¿½ describing the crimes as ï¿½incidents being discussed since past two days.ï¿½ He has taken a similar approach in the past when addressing cases in which vigilante groups affiliated with his political movement have attacked and killed Muslims and Dalits ï¿½ members of Indiaï¿½s lowest caste ï¿½ who they falsely accused of killing cows, which are sacred to Hindus.
Mr. Modiï¿½s silence is as perplexing as it is distressing. He seems to have failed to learn the lesson of his predecessors who did not forcefully respond to protests in late 2012 and early 2013 after a young woman was raped and killed on a public bus in New Delhi. That government, which was led by the Congress party, paid a heavy political price for its heartlessness in the 2014 parliamentary elections; the B.J.P. won the elections in large part because Mr. Modi promised to make the government more responsive to the needs of Indians who were left behind by a government dogged by corruption scandals and widely considered rudderless.
Instead, he has exhibited a pattern of silence and deflection that is deeply worrying to anybody who cares about the health of the worldï¿½s largest democracy."
The New York Times,America,New Delhi,"India Is Close to Buying a Russian Missile System, Despite U.S. Sanctions"," Indiaï¿½s defense minister is visiting Moscow this week to finalize the purchase of a Russian missile defense system, Indian officials say, in a weapons deal that would violate American sanctions against Russia.
The potential $6 billion deal comes at a time when the Trump administration is both weighing more extensive sanctions against Russia and trying to forge a military alliance with India. Indian officials say the agreement could be finalized as soon as this week, with India purchasing five S-400 Triumf systems, an antiaircraft missile array that can also intercept missiles.
If the purchase goes through, the Trump administration would have to choose between punishing India for violating the sanctions or granting an exemption to avoid souring the relationship.
The United States has been trying to cultivate India as a strategic ally and a hedge against Chinese military expansion. Washington has typically dangled defense deals as a way to improve military ties with countries, and it has courted India aggressively. Lockheed Martin offered last summer to move the production of F-16 fighter jets from Texas to India if India agreed to buy the plane.
ï¿½In the past few years youï¿½ve seen a massive transition where more equipment is being bought from the U.S. Thatï¿½s because the U.S. wants a closer relationship with India, and defense deals are essentially diplomatic deals,ï¿½ said Shailesh Kumar, the Asia director of the Eurasia Group, a geopolitical risk consulting firm.


 
Sukhoi-30 planes, made by Russia and flown by the Indian Air Force. Russia is still Indiaï¿½s top arms supplier, but the United States has been catching up. 

ï¿½My suspicion is that America will not deem the S-400 purchase as sanctions-worthy,ï¿½ Mr. Kumar said. ï¿½Thereï¿½s too much at stake for bilateral relations. If the U.S. goes for sanctions, it will undermine the good will the U.S. has been trying to build up with India over the last two decades.ï¿½


Washington is increasing pressure on Moscow over its meddling in American elections and over the poisoning of a Russian spy in Salisbury, England, last month. American officials told Reuters that additional sanctions on Russia could be announced this week, expanding on a previous round that passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress in August.
ï¿½We are engaging with a range of countries to avert future defense acquisitions, and the secretary of state will take appropriate action when and if we determine sanctionable activity has occurred,ï¿½ a spokeswoman from the State Department said in an emailed response to questions. The spokeswoman did not specify what action Washington would take if the deal went through. Indiaï¿½s purchase of the S-400 had been stalled over the past year by pricing concerns, and an official at the Ministry of Defense said Thursday that negotiations in Moscow were ongoing.
The potential purchase of the Russian missile system, also referred to by NATO as the SA-21 Growler, demonstrates Indiaï¿½s continued reliance on Russian military hardware at a time when the United States is trying to increase its arms sales to the country.
Washingtonï¿½s military sales to India went from nearly zero a decade and a half ago to some $15 billion today. Over the past five years, the United States has edged up to become Indiaï¿½s second largest arms supplier, just behind Russia. Russia accounted for 62 percent of arms sales to India over the past five years, down from 79 percent from 2008 to 2012, according to the Stockholm International Peace Institute, which tracks military spending.



 
President Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India at a Manila summit meeting in November. The United States has been trying to cultivate India as a strategic ally and a hedge against Chinese military expansion. 

American officials acknowledge that Indiaï¿½s large stock of Russian equipment is a fact of life. But the pending S-400 deal is alarming to the Americans because it is a relatively new and state-of-the-art weapons system, not just an agreement to service existing equipment.
ï¿½The Russians are angry at India for going to the Americans for a lot of equipment, because India was their backyard as far as military purchases went,ï¿½ said Rahul Bedi of Janeï¿½s Information Group, which tracks defense sales and is based in London. ï¿½The Indians are scrambling to curry favor again with Russians and the S-400s are a way to do it.ï¿½
India will be hosting a defense exhibition next week, inviting global weapons manufacturers to showcase their hardware. The United States and Russia are both sending official delegations.


  

Indiaï¿½s pending deal is also another potential setback to the United Statesï¿½ struggling Patriot missile defense system, produced by Raytheon. Turkey, despite being a NATO ally, signed an agreement to buy the Russian S-400 system in December, ignoring American concerns.
American officials have also tried to sway India to purchase Patriot missile systems instead of the S-400. But the Patriot system has faced recent scrutiny after it failed to protect Saudi Arabiaï¿½s capital from missiles fired by Houthi militants in Yemen.
ï¿½India wasnï¿½t very impressed with the Patriot compared with the S-400, which wins hands-down in capability, in its availability, service availability. Itï¿½s a more efficient system,ï¿½ said Mr. Bedi of Janeï¿½s.
But, he added, ï¿½India requires so much, thereï¿½s enough food on the table for everyone to eat and have a go at it.ï¿½"
The New York Times,America,New Delhi,Donald Trump Jr. Retreats From Foreign Policy on India Trip," After days of controversy over whether he would blur the lines between American foreign policy and his familyï¿½s real estate business during a trip to India to sell condos, Donald Trump Jr. on Friday abandoned plans to give a policy speech and instead gave an interview with an Indian journalist, sticking to safe topics.
His remarks in the interview ï¿½ about his fatherï¿½s successful 2016 presidential campaign, how little the family sees him now, and Indiaï¿½s great entrepreneurial spirit ï¿½ were so anodyne that when the Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan entered the room near the end of the interview, people lifted their phones to take photos of the actor and stopped paying attention to the oldest child of Americaï¿½s president.
ï¿½Iï¿½m here as a businessman,ï¿½ Mr. Trump told a crowd of about 2,000 business and political leaders, who were gathered for the annual business conference hosted by Indiaï¿½s most powerful media company, The Times Group. ï¿½Iï¿½m not representing anyone.ï¿½
But his efforts to distance himself from administration policy were met with some skepticism.
ï¿½Though he claims that itï¿½s not an official speech, we take it as an official statement,ï¿½ said P. V. Sunil, a managing director of a company that builds malls and cinema complexes in India and Singapore. ï¿½He speaks to his father more than anyone here.ï¿½
Mr. Trump has spent the last week in India promoting new luxury housing projects in the country, the biggest foreign market for Trump real estate interests outside of North America.



He originally intended to give a speech Friday on ï¿½Indo-Pacificï¿½ cooperation, a policy idea recently championed by President Trump as a counterweight to Chinaï¿½s rising influence. That sparked an uproar, underscoring how the Trump family, with some members working in the White House and others running the family business, has obscured the traditional line between public and private interests.
Ethicists and former government officials with both major political parties have raised concerns that foreign-policy decisions made by the White House could affect the Trump Organizationï¿½s business prospects, and in turn, the presidentï¿½s wealth. Although the president has turned over management of the company to Donald Trump Jr. and another son, Eric Trump, he still holds a huge financial interest in Trump projects around the world.
Two organizers of Fridayï¿½s conference said that they had proposed the Indo-Pacific topic to Donald Trump Jr.ï¿½s team and that he had agreed to address it. On Thursday, after criticism by ethicists and a Democratic senator, Mr. Trump requested that the topic be changed, they said.
Shortly after Mr. Trumpï¿½s interview, Indiaï¿½s prime minister, Narendra Modi, gave his own keynote speech about Indiaï¿½s economic progress.
Mr. Trump has downplayed ethical concerns during his India visit, saying the companyï¿½s promise not to seek new foreign projects during his fatherï¿½s presidency had hurt its business.
Eric Trump said in an interview on Friday that the criticism of his brother was unfair and unjustified. He said that although he was not involved in the discussions regarding his brotherï¿½s speech, there was nothing wrong with the original topic.
ï¿½We have been doing business in India for many years,ï¿½ he said. ï¿½I donï¿½t understand the problem with celebrating the camaraderie between two great countries.ï¿½
During his onstage interview, Donald Trump Jr. went out of his way to suggest that the Trumps do not mix politics and business, even when they all get together.
ï¿½We see him so little that itï¿½s really about being a family,ï¿½ he said of his father. ï¿½We donï¿½t talk politics.ï¿½
Donald Trump Jr. was deeply involved in his fatherï¿½s campaign, meeting with a Russian lawyer who promised political dirt on Hillary Clinton, the Democratic candidate. That meeting, and how Mr. Trump and the White House responded to public disclosure of it last July, are now being scrutinized by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. In India, officials have struggled to understand what the Trump White House means for Indo-American relations.
ï¿½Under Trump, you cannot be sure the policy today will be the policy tomorrow,ï¿½ said C. Raja Mohan, a foreign-policy analyst and director of Carnegie India. ï¿½That is a huge problem.ï¿½
India views some of the presidentï¿½s evolving positions as favorable and others as less so.
His recent criticism of Pakistan as a haven for terrorists has been music to the ears of leaders in New Delhi, some of whom view that neighboring country in much the same way. The president has also signaled that he sees a more important role for India, along with other traditional American allies like Japan and Australia, in an Indo-Pacific grouping that would curb Beijingï¿½s influence.
The Trump administration has strengthened military ties with New Delhi and discussed a flurry of defense agreements, including one that may see the F-16 fighter jet move its production line from Texas to India.
At the same time, there are significant tensions between the Modi government and the Trump administration on several critical issues, including immigration and trade policy.
In an effort to boost Indian manufacturing, the Modi government has raised tariffs on imported products like electronics and beauty products. India has also tangled with American drug companies over patent protections for their products. In 2017, the United States had a $23 billion trade deficit with India.
Indian immigrants are also a large segment of the work force of American technology companies. President Trump campaigned on curbing such immigration and has gradually tightened the rules governing the H-1B and other visas used by tech workers.
On Thursday, the administration announced rules that would make it harder for Indian outsourcers that have many corporate customers to bring workers to the United States and move them from site to site. Fridayï¿½s conference was in full swing as news spread of the administrationï¿½s latest move to restrict H-1B visas.
With the younger Mr. Trump, who has voiced strong support for his fatherï¿½s tough stance on immigration, sitting in the audience, Uberï¿½s chief executive officer, Dara Khosrowshahi, took a dig at the president.
ï¿½The American dream is the single most incredible brand in the world,ï¿½ said Mr. Khosrowshahi, whose family immigrated from Iran. ï¿½Iï¿½m worried that the attitude this American administration has on immigration will ruin that brand.ï¿½
The journalist who interviewed Mr. Trump, Supriya Shrinate, pressed him on immigration, asking whether he thought it was fair that he could travel the world and invest in places like India, while the United States tightened immigration rules.
Mr. Trump dodged the question, before Ms. Shrinate finally asked: ï¿½Is the American dream still alive? A lot of people in this audience beg to differ.ï¿½
ï¿½I think 100 percent it is,ï¿½ Mr. Trump said."
The New York Times,America,Davos,"Modi, in Davos, Praises Globalization Without Noting Indiaï¿½s Trade Barriers","Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India issued a strong call on Tuesday for nations to embrace globalization, combat climate change and strengthen international institutions like the World Trade Organization.
ï¿½Forces of protectionism are raising their heads against globalization,ï¿½ Mr. Modi said during a speech to the World Economic Forum here. ï¿½Their intention is not only to avoid globalization, but they also want to reverse its natural flow.ï¿½
Notably missing from the speech was any mention of recent moves by Mr. Modiï¿½s own government to restrict imports into India as part of a broad industrial policy meant to force foreign companies to increase manufacturing operations in the country. In essence, he is pursuing a protectionist agenda, at odds with the mantra of globalization.
Mr. Modiï¿½s speech reflects the tenor of the times. As President Trump pushes an ï¿½America Firstï¿½ strategy, global leaders are lining up to position themselves as a counterpoint, even if there is sometimes a disconnect between the rhetoric and the reality.
In Davos last year, President Xi Jinping of China positioned himself as a champion of economic globalization in a rebuke to Mr. Trump, who, as president-elect at the time, was threatening to impose steep tariffs. Yet China has long bent the rules of commerce to fit its own needs. 
Mr. Modi is following a similar path in India, as he looks to nurture growth in his sprawling economy and to create jobs.
Last month, Indiaï¿½s government imposed stiff tariffs on imports of cellphones, video cameras and televisions. The move put heavy pressure on Apple, which ships most of the iPhones it sells in India from China, to do more manufacturing in India.
Mr. Modiï¿½s government is also considering a recommendation by Indiaï¿½s Directorate General of Safeguards, Customs and Central Excise that the country impose 70 percent tariffs on imported solar panels. Such a move would appear to conflict with Mr. Modiï¿½s call here for international action on climate change. Introducing such stiff tariffs could well encourage the production of more solar panels in India, but it could also make solar power far more expensive for Indian consumers and, in turn, hurt the fight against climate change.
At 70 percent, the tariffs that India is considering on imported solar panels would be more than double those that the Trump administration said on Monday it would impose on such panels. Mr. Modi did not indicate in his speech what his government might decide on the issue.
The Trump administration faces a dilemma of its own over whether to follow Indiaï¿½s lead in placing tariffs on consumer electronics. Mr. Trumpï¿½s trade advisers are considering whether to limit imports of such goods from China amid a broader dispute over whether Chinese companies are systematically violating American intellectual property.
Mark Wu, a former trade negotiator for the United States who is now an assistant professor of trade law at Harvard University and who attended Mr. Modiï¿½s speech, said India faced a challenge in terms of imports: attracting foreign manufacturers without appearing to violate international trade norms.
ï¿½While the prime minister articulated all the right messages on globalization at Davos, his government remains firmly committed to a strategy of leveraging its market size to drive industrial policies to spur greater high-tech manufacturing in India,ï¿½ Mr. Wu said. ï¿½This is bound to cause greater trade frictions ahead.ï¿½ In his speech, Mr. Modi echoed many of the pro-globalization themes expressed here last year by Mr. Xi, the leader of the country with the highest import tariffs of any large economy besides India.
Although he did not mention China, Mr. Modi extolled India as a model of political openness and economic growth. ï¿½We Indians very well understand the importance of a democratic environment and freedoms,ï¿½ he said.
China has begun to push hard in recent months to address its environmental problems, replacing coal-fired heating systems with natural gas where possible and closing factories that are heavy polluters. Pollution in India, which is at least a decade behind China in raising its citizensï¿½ standard of living, continues to increase.
A ranking of countries on pollution and ecosystem protection released here on Tuesday showed India falling to 177 out of 180, down from 156 two years ago. By comparison, China was No. 120 on the list, which was compiled by Yaleï¿½s Center for Environmental Law and Policy.
ï¿½They are driving economic growth, but not paying attention to what I would call the parallel challenge of sustainable development: avoiding environmental degradation,ï¿½ Daniel Esty, the centerï¿½s director, said of India.
As in the United States, industrial policies in India meant to foster domestic manufacturing can collide with a push by environmentalists and clean-energy electric utilities for solar panels, even imported ones, to be deployed as widely and as cheaply as possible. Among the other people attending Mr. Modiï¿½s speech was Sumant Sinha, chairman and chief executive of ReNew Power Ventures, a company based on the outskirts of New Delhi that builds clean energy projects.
Mr. Sinha said he admired Mr. Modiï¿½s efforts to make it easier for foreign and domestic companies alike to do business in India. But he said he also worried that if the recommendation for 70 percent tariffs on imported solar panels were adopted, solar energy could become unaffordable for many Indians.
ï¿½The person buying the power would like the cost of the power to be as low as possible,ï¿½ he said.
Devendra Fadnavis, the chief minister of Maharashtra, the vast Indian state that includes Mumbai and big manufacturing cities like Pune, also attended Mr. Modiï¿½s speech. He said that he saw growing interest among companies from outside India to manufacture in the country. Foxconn, the giant Taiwanese manufacturer that produces the bulk of Appleï¿½s consumer electronics, is in negotiations with Maharashtra officials to set up a large factory there.
Maharashtra has offered Foxconn land at a major Mumbai port as a way of addressing the companyï¿½s concerns about transportation links, Mr. Fadnavis said. But he also offered a strong defense of Indiaï¿½s tariffs on imports, saying that the countryï¿½s large number of poor farmers made it important to proceed carefully.
ï¿½We want to open the door,ï¿½ he said. ï¿½On the other hand, we want to protect our domestic concerns, like food security and the farmers.ï¿½"
