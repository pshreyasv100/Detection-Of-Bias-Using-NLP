Times Of India,India,New Delhi,"The US on Thursday reaffirmed its commitment to help India join the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), reported news agency ANI.
  ","""We are working with partners to secure India's Nuclear Suppliers Group membership,"" said Kenneth Juster, the American ambassador to India, in his inaugural policy speech.
     It is noteworthy that Juster went on to describe India as a ""leading power"" in the Indo-Pacific region.
     ""India is a leading power in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond. For India and the US, Indo-Pacific is vital for the security and prosperity of our people as well as others. Together we want to ensure a free and open region, where rule of law and democratic principles are reflected,"" he said.
     ""We want to promote respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, guarantee freedom of navigation over flight and commerce and other lawful uses of the sea, ensure territorial and maritime disputes are resolved peacefully consistent with international laws,"" he added.
     Juster was at pains to clarify that 'America First' and 'Make in India' were ""not incompatible."" Instead, he said, the two had the potential to be ""mutually beneficial, increase economic interactions and volume of trade.""
     In fact, he went as far as to suggest that India emerge an as ""alternative hub"" to China for US businesses in the region.
     He also echoed President Donald Trump's belief that India play a bigger role in Afghanistan, even as he stressed that the situation would not improve till ""Pakistan does not contribute positively.""
     ""(There are a) Few areas of collaboration. One is Afghanistan, where we both have a strong interest in promoting peace, security and prosperity. Our leaders are committed to supporting Afghanistan and helping build that country's democratic institutions. Pakistan is also important to the situation in Afghanistan. I don't think we are going to get stability and security in Afghanistan if Pakistan does not contribute positively to that,"" he said.
     He reaffirmed the American position that the leaders of Pakistan had not ""done all that they could"" to rid it of safe havens for terror, and this had led to suspension of security assistance.
     ""President Trump and other US leaders have been clear that we will not tolerate cross-border terrorism or terrorist safe havens anywhere. As part of this effort, last month we launched the first-ever US-India Counter-Terrorism Designations Dialogue,"" he added.
     Juster also attempted to ease worries about the immigration issue in the US, that came to the fore with last year's Presidential election in the country.
     ""US is probably as open a country as any in the world and we probably take more immigrants per year compared to any other country. We are a country of immigrants and that has helped drive our economy, made us what we are. That is not going to change,"" he said.

Times Of India,India,New Delhi,"After China put up a virtually permanent roadblock for proscribing Masood Azhar by the UNSC, India and US are mulling options for their next steps.
  ","In December, Indian and US officials will meet for the first time for a dialogue on coordinating terrorist designations by both countries. The two sides will discuss options of keeping terrorists and terror groups like Jaish-e-Muhammad under pressure.
     This will include discussions on the next terrorist that will be put up for sanctions by the UNSC's 1267 committee.
     The new consultation mechanism was decided during the Modi-Trump summit this summer. In the joint statement that followed the summit, both sides, ""committed to strengthen cooperation against terrorist threats from groups including al-Qaida, ISIS, JeM, Lashkar-e-Taiba, D-Company, and their affiliates. ... the leaders welcomed a new consultation mechanism on domestic and international terrorist designations listing proposals.""
     For instance, Abdul Rauf Asghar, Masood Azhar's brother, may find his name on the next list for sanctions. He was charged in the Pathankot terror attack. Azhar's second brother, Maulana Ibrahim Athar Alvi is accused of masterminding the IC-814 hijack which forced India to release Azhar from jail in return for the passengers of the jet.
     India has a list of other terror leaders operating with the support of Pakistan's military-intelligence establishment, who India wants to put up on the 1267 committee.
     India wants China to continue to shield Pakistan at the multilateral level — if Beijing blocks sanctions against deadly terrorists repeatedly, it could succeed in painting itself as a supporter of global terrorism. Chinese officials reportedly expressed confidence that they would not be pressured on Azhar by the US given the US needed their support on keeping an increasingly hostile North Korea in check. China's decision came even as Beijing itself demanded extra security from Pakistan for its new envoy from ETIM terrorists — many of them trained in Pakistan.
     The joint statement added that India and United States would work together to ""prevent terrorist travel and to disrupt global recruitment efforts by expanding intelligence-sharing and operational-level counterterrorism cooperation.""
     As part of the travel vetting programmesin both countries, India and US had also decided to exchange information on ""known and suspected terrorists for travel screening."" The likes of David Headley, who conducted numerous reconnaissance trips to India to prepare for the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, could appear on the Indian security radar.

Times Of India,India,United Nations,India to UNSC: Focus on eliminating terror safe havens in Pakistan,"Pakistan needs to change its ""mindset"" of differentiating between good and bad terrorists, India said at the UN Security Council, urging it to focus on challenges posed by terrorism emanating from the safe havens from across the border.  
  
  Indian Ambassador to the UN Syed Akbaruddin told the Security Council that it is India's vision to see Afghanistan regain its place.
     He added that New Delhi remain committed to work closely with its regional and international partners to bring peace, security, stability and prosperity in Afghanistan.
     Earlier, the US told the UN Security Council that the status quo regarding terrorist safe havens in Pakistan is not acceptable.
   The US had said+
  that the status quo regarding continued terror safe havens in Pakistan is not acceptable and insisted that Islamabad join its efforts to bring a resolution to the conflict.
   
UN chief calls for 'balance of power' in UNSC    ""We seek to work cohesively and effectively with Pakistan, but cannot be successful if the status quo, one where terrorist organisations are given sanctuary inside the country's borders, is allowed to continue,"" US deputy secretary of state John Sullivan told the ministerial meeting.
     Afghan deputy foreign minister Hekmat Khalil Karzai too reiterated the presence of terrorist safe haven in Pakistan.
     Meanwhile, Pakistan continued to be in denial.
     Permanent Representative of Pakistan to the UN Maleeha Lodhi, responding to the Indian ambassador,
  raked up the case of Jadhav+
  , who was captured in March last year and sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court for alleged spying, an accusation that India has dismissed as concocted.
     ""Those who talk of changing mindset need to look within, at their own record of subversion against my country as our capture of an Indian spy has proven beyond doubt,"" Lodhi told the members of the UN Security Council, without naming Jadhav.

Times Of India,India,New Delhi,American shutdown: Flights from India to US not affected,"Despite the ripple effect of the United States shut down across the world, no flights from India to America had been cancelled, according to sources.
  
  
  Though travellers were not impacted immediately, industry players said that if the government shutdown was prolonged, it would have an effect in the near future.
     ""The US government shutdown will have no impact on those travelling from India. Airlines are functioning as per their schedules, the air traffic control, immigration and customs services which are deemed as essential services are not covered by the shutdown,"" said Karan Anand, Head of Relationships at Cox &amp; Kings.
     ""The government shutdown could impact travellers planning a trip to the US in the foreseeable future,"" said Sharat Dhall, COO(B2C) at Yatra.com, adding that ""while there will be a miniscule impact on air traffic controllers, visa processing will certainly face some delay. Also, passport processing for the US citizens visiting India or other foreign nations might also get delayed.""
     The US government began shutting down on Saturday, putting thousands of workers on unpaid leave after the Senate failed to pass a stopgap budget.
   Air India has not cancelled or postponed any flights to the US, a source familiar with the matter said. Air India flies to four US cities daily -- San Francisco, Chicago, Washington and New York, In New York, it flies to two airports Newark and John F. Kennedy.
     The shutdown marked the first anniversary of President Donald Trump's inauguration.
     It is the first shutdown in US history to happen while the same ruling party controlled both House of Congress and the Senate.
     Despite last-minute bipartisan meetings, the bill to fund the government until February 16, did not receive the required number of 60 votes in the senate.
     The budget proposal presented by the Republicans on Friday night got more votes in favour (50) than against (48), but they were insufficient to approve funds. Four Republicans voted against the bill while five Democrats broke rank to support it.

  In 2016, India was the ninth largest trading partner of the US and one of the major countries with which America has had trade deficit of more than $30 billion. This is expected to continue in 2017 as well, an issue which has repeatedly been raised by President Donald Trump and his top officials in their interaction with their Indian counterpart.

     Official figures of annual bilateral trade are yet to come, but the USISPF estimates are based on its own research and surveys.
     India, Aghi said, has proactively started working on addressing the issue of trade deficit with India.
     ""India roughly has a thousand plane orders with US companies. That will start bringing trade imbalance in the right direction. India, last year bought $2 billion worth of energy from the US. India spends roughly $80 billion dollars acquiring energy. And I think a lot of that will start moving to the US,"" he said.
     ""I think next five years, you will see a little more balance in the trade between two countries,"" Aghi said.
     India and the US have set a goal of increasing the bilateral trade to $500 billion a year.

Times Of India,India,"Islamabad, Pakistan","US pressing India, Pakistan for dialogue: Report ","The US is quietly nudging Pakistan and India to re-engage as the Trump administration seeks to defuse tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours, according to a media report on Monday.
  
  
  America's objective to normalise ties between the two South Asian rivals is part of its efforts to have a more focused approach on the Afghan endgame.
     US secretary of state Rex Tillerson took up the issue with the leadership of both Pakistan and India during his recent visit to the two countries, the Express Tribune quoting government officials and diplomatic sources as saying.
     ""Behind the scenes, efforts appear to have started paying dividends since Tillerson's visit, as there has been a noticeable reduction in violence along the Line of Control (LoC) in the disputed Kashmir region,"" the paper said.
     The border between the two nations has been the scene of bloody clashes between the armies of Pakistan and India for the last couple of years. The current year has been the worst in terms of ceasefire violations as well as civilian casualties.
     Officials with the knowledge of the backdoor manoeuvres confirmed to the paper that the Trump administration wanted to see a lowering of tensions between the two neighbours.
     A senior official, who requested not to be identified because he was not authorised to speak to the media, said Tillerson had informed Pakistan that the Trump administration was willing to encourage a rapprochement between Islamabad and New Delhi.
     The surprise decision by Pakistan to allow a meeting between convicted Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav and his wife was also being linked to the quiet efforts by the US. Pakistan, however, publically insisted that the offer was made purely on the humanitarian grounds.
     The former Indian Navy officer was sentenced to death after a Field Court Martial on charges of espionage and involvement in terrorist activities.
     Officials are reluctant to link Pakistan's decision on Jadhav as well as the brief lull in LoC clashes to the US intervention.
     They said it was too early to draw any such conclusions as the Trump Administration was still struggling to come up with a workable roadmap for Afghanistan and South Asia.
     The official, nevertheless, made it clear that continued tensions between Pakistan and India would certainly undermine US efforts to bring some semblance of peace in Afghanistan.
     Historically, Islamabad has not been averse to third-party intervention, but India has publically opposed such approaches.
     The official said the Pakistani side had urged the US to use its influence over India for the resumption of dialogue after a number of terror attacks in India.
     It is, however, not clear if the two sides would resume the full spectrum of talks, considering the timing.
     Since Pakistan is also just a few months away from parliamentary elections, it is highly unlikely that structured dialogue would be restored. However, political leaders and officials may interact with each other as a result of US efforts in order to arrest any further slide in ties between Pakistan and India, the report said.

     The luncheon, organised at a very short notice, was attended by some of the top Indian-Americans from across the country.
     ""It is always a delight to see the sense of pride that Ambassador Haley has in her Indian roots, and the high value she attaches to the India-US relationship even as she plays such a prominent role in the American political sphere,"" Sarna told PTI a day after.

     ""It didn't make sense to me because when you look at the values, they're the same. When you look at the work ethic and what they believe from a corporate standpoint -- the same. When you look at the research and all the things that we do, these two democracies have so much in common,"" she said.
     It makes sense for the two countries to be friends, the top Indian-American in the Trump administration said.
     ""We're seeing a growing interest, and a growing relationship and seeing that happen. The president is very very fond of what is happening with India, growing that relationship trying to make sure that we do more with India,"" Haley said.
     ""I think that sky's the limit now. We are going to continue to try and show the values of India to the United States and continue trying to show the values of the US to India,"" she said.
     Haley said Modi was aggressively pursuing reforms and changes in India.
     ""He very much wants to streamline and do all of these reforms, that are very true for this (Trump) administration too. So I think it's a good combination to have them (Trump- Modi) together,"" Haley said.
     Later in the evening, Haley attended the maiden State of the Union address by Trump at the US Capitol.
     Haley is the first ever cabinet ranking Indian-American in any presidential administration.
     In his remarks, Sarna described Haley as star of the Trump administration.
     Sarna said Haley's story really showed that ""can't is not an option"".
     ""Coming from a coming from a family of immigrants, coming from a relatively small rural town and moving so quickly to hold the post of Governor was in itself a huge achievement,"" said Sarna.

  North Korea fired an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on Wednesday which Pyongyang's top leader Kim Jong-Un said gave his country the capability to anywhere in the US.

     Nauert said China had conveyed to the US in the past that they share America's commitment to the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula.
     ""We expect that they will adhere to that and follow through,"" she said.
     Expressing concern over the latest missile test by North Koreans, she said it was of great concern to the entire world.
     ""We have seen two successful UN Security Council resolutions that were unanimously passed late summer and over the fall, including Russia and China as members of that. We have put together our maximum pressure campaign, which many nations have taken part in. That campaign consists of the US and many other nations issuing sanctions,"" she said.
     Nauert said the US had also asked other countries to shrink the size of the North Korean footprint in many other countries.
     ""We have asked other nations to kick out North Korean guest workers, simply because those North Korean guest workers are essentially working as slave labourers. They don't get to keep the money that they make,"" Nauert said.
     ""Much of that money goes back to North Korea, and we recognise that that money, as it doesn't go home to their families - we see the conditions of the people, we see the humanitarian rights issues in North Korea. Their people are starving,"" she said.
     Nauert said a part of the US' ""maximum pressure campaign"" was to choke off that money supply that goes into the North Korean regime.
     ""We have seen more than 20 countries around the world jump on board that maximum pressure campaign and start to take place with those activities: shrinking the North Korean guest workers, kicking out ambassadors, those types of things,"" she said.
     The US regards that campaign as being successful, but the entire world acknowledges that this is not something that will necessarily change overnight, she said.
     ""That campaign is a long effort and we will continue to push ahead with that. Obviously, this new development is something that's very serious,"" she said.

  Ivanka, 36, will lead a high-powered American delegation of officials, women entrepreneurs and businessmen for the Global Entrepreneurship Summit (GES) 2017 in Hyderabad, a three-day summit beginning November 28.
     The summit will be attended by 1,500 entrepreneurs from 170 countries and would have around 350 participants from the US, a large number of whom are Indian-Americans.
     Ivanka would deliver the keynote address at the summit, which would be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
     She said that her aim for this summit is to serve as an open and collaborative environment for the exchange of ideas, to broaden networks, and to empower entrepreneurs to take their ideas and passion to the next level.
     ""The US and India will continue to work together to increase economic opportunities and inclusive growth. I very much look forward to my visit and to seeing Prime Minister Modi and Foreign Minister (Sushma) Swaraj once again,"" Ivanka told reporters on Tuesday.
     Incredibly excited to be visiting India next week for the eighth annual Global Entrepreneurship Summit (GES), she said.
     The summit, co-hosted by the US and India, ""is a testament to the strong friendship between our two people and the growing economic and security partnership between the two nations,"" she said.

     Prime Minister Modi during his visit to the White House in June had invited Ivanka to visit India.
     Ivanka is an American television personality, fashion designer, author and businesswoman, besides being an advocate for the education and empowerment of women and girls.
     The daughter and adviser of the US President has been an executive vice president of the family owned 'The Trump Organisation' as well as serving as a boardroom judge on her father's TV show 'The Apprentice'.

     In addition to the 1,200 emerging entrepreneurs, the summit will also see participation of an additional 300 investors and supporters, such as incubator and accelerator representatives, joining from around the world.
     ""The event will create an important platform for entrepreneurs and particularly women to pitch their ideas, build partnerships, secure funding and find their target customers.

Times Of India,India,Kolkata,"India, US important partners to maintain regional stability","India is a partner of the United States for maintaining peace and stability in the region, US Consul General Craig Hall said today.
Hall, who was speaking at an interactive session for fostering entrepreneurs and start-ups, said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has accelerated change in India.
The two countries are the best of friends, Hall said when asked to comment on the recent Indo-US global business summit -- GES 2017 -- in Hyderabad where Advisor to the US President, Ivanka Trump, was present along with Modi.
""We have to hang together for peace and stability in the region,"" he said.
Hall said he wants to see more action with foreign business partners and would like to support industry body Assocham and the ALFA network, who are working to create a conducive climate for new-age entrepreneurs.
Hall said both India and the US share beliefs about the need of empowering the entrepreneurs and opening the door to potential investors and mentors.
""It has been a prerogative of the US as well as Indian government to create a favourable climate to enable the growth of more innovators and reduce the regulatory hurdles that limit opportunities for any prospective start-up,"" he said.
He said that in the current year, USA is number five on the list of foeign investors in India with USD 660 million which is nearly 6 per cent of the total FDI in this country.

Times Of India,India,New Delhi,US congratulates India for joining Australia Group," Emphasizing the Indian government's ""excellent"" non-proliferation credentials, the US today congratulated India on becoming the newest member of the Australian Group.
  

  Calling India a valued non-proliferation partner, the US Department of State said that Washington looks forward to working with India.
     ""India is a valued non-proliferation partner, we look forward to continuing our work with Indian in the Australia Group in furtherance of our shared non-proliferation goals,"" the DoS said in a statement.
     Last week, India became a member of the 'Australia Group' (AG), helping it to bolster its credentials in the field of non-proliferation and also help it acquire critical technologies.
     Following its entry into the AG, India became a member of the three of the four non-proliferation regimes, Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), the Wassenaar Agreement (WA) and the Australia Group (AG).
     The only one remaining is the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG). India has managed entry into all three groups despite not being a signatory to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), and despite China's attempts to stonewall its bid to enter the NSG.
     AG is a cooperative and voluntary group of countries working to counter the spread of materials, equipment and technologies that could contribute to the development or acquisition of chemical and biological weapons by states or terrorist groups. In December, India gained entry into WA. In June last year, India joined the MTCR, another key export control regime, as a full member.
     Significantly, China, which stonewalled India's entry into the 48-nation NSG is not a member of the WA or the MTCR, both of which play a significant role in promoting transparency and greater responsibility in transfers of conventional arms and dual-use goods and technologies.
     Since its civil nuclear deal with the US, India has been trying to get into export control regimes such as the NSG, the MTCR, the Australia Group and the Wassenaar Arrangement that regulate the conventional, nuclear, biological and chemicals weapons and technologies.

Times Of India,India,"Islamabad, Pakistan","US trying to convince us that India is not a threat, says Pakistan defence minister"," The US has been trying to convince Pakistan that India was not a threat to it and Islamabad should change its strategic stance towards New Delhi, defence minister Khurram Dastagir Khan has said.
  
     He also said that it is time for a courteous yet ""ruthlessly candid dialogue"" with the US ""with everything on the table"" to remove all misunderstandings between Islamabad and Washington.
     Reading out a policy statement on the government's foreign policy contours and the security situation in Pakistan in the National Assembly yesterday, he regretted that the US played down India's aggressive posturing along the Line of Control (LoC) and Working Boundary, the Dawn reported on Tuesday.
     The minister said the perception of India was one of the foundational divergences between Pakistan and the US.
     ""It's time for a courteous yet ruthlessly candid dialogue between Pakistan and the US with everything on the table,"" the defence minister said.
     Khan said that Washington had been trying to convince Pakistan that India was not a threat and, therefore, Islamabad should change its strategic stance.
   
Why it's so difficult for the US to crack down on Pakistan. The US does not want to completely rupture its relationship with Pakistan, where anti-American sentiment already runs high. Washington's footprint in Afghanistan is much smaller than it was at the height of the war, and it needs access to Pakistan's supply lines and airspace.    ""But the truism remains true. Both India's capacity and intents are today hostile towards Pakistan,"" he alleged.
     Pakistan accuses India of using Afghan soil for carrying out hostile activities against it, a charge India has dismissed.
     Khan alleged that ""India has amassed men, material and garrisons along the border with Pakistan"" and said that 2017 was the deadliest year in terms of LoC violations by India and the killings of civilians.
     ""India today is a highly militarised and an increasingly belligerent neighbour,"" he claimed, adding that the unrelentingly hostile and anti-Pakistan stance taken by the current Indian government has reduced drastically the space for any advocacy of peace.
     The minister said Pakistan was being made a scapegoat as the US was not winning (the war on terror) in Afghanistan.
     He said Pakistan had cleared the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), Karachi and Balochistan under the Operation 'Zarb-i-Azb' and there were no safe havens for terrorists in the country.
     He urged the US to recognise the sacrifices Pakistan and its people had made in the war on terror since 2001.
     He also criticised the US for not pursuing internal reconciliation in Afghanistan, which had now become a safe haven for terrorists."

The deep partnership between the two countries was seen in the US co-hosting the just-concluded Global Entrepreneurship Summit in Hyderabad, along with the Indian government, he said.
The US, Vajda said, was eager to promote peace and prosperity in a close partnership with India, adding that it was fundamental to the flow of trade in south Asia.
""We want to do that not at the expense of any other country and also do not want to prioritise any one over the other,"" he said.
On the Indo-Pak conflict, Vajda said, ""The US condemns terrorism emanating from the Pakistani soil. But the two countries should resolve the differences through dialogue.""
He also said the US was in favour of a dignified return of the Rohingyas to Myanmar and their proper resettlement.
In an interaction organised by the Bengal Chambers of Commerce and Industries (BCCI), Vajda spoke about an increasing US interest in India, which was a natural market owing to its huge middle class population.
  As the connectivity with the East increased, more channels would open up for expanding business links, he said. "

 5,000 Crore For 145 Ultra-Light Howitzers","India and the US are likely to sign an agreement for the purchase of 145 American Ultra-Light Howitzers, worth about Rs 5,000 crore, this fiscal, the first deal for artillery guns since the Bofors scandal in 1980s.The Defence Ministry on Thursday cleared the file for M777 guns, which would now be sent to the Finance Ministry before being put up before the Cabinet Committee on Security.Sources said the approval for certain ""deviations"" were made.The ministry has already shortened the supply period of the guns, with a strike range of 25 km, though the exact period could not be known.India had sent a Letter of Request to the US government showing interest in buying the guns which will be deployed in high altitude areas in Arunachal Pradesh and Ladakh, bordering China.The US had responded with a Letter of Acceptance (LOA) and the ministry had in June looked into the terms and conditions and approved it.The offsets, under which BAE Systems, manufacturer of the gun, will invest about $200 million, will be pursued independently.While 25 guns will come to India in a fly away condition, the rest will be assembled at the proposed Assembly Integration and Test facility for the weapon system in India in partnership with Mahindra..

NDTV,India,Washington,Trump's 'America First' Strategy Can Damage Indo-US Ties,"Speculated to be the next US envoy to India, Indian-American strategist Ashley Tellis today said that US President-elect Donald Trump's 'America first' policy can damage India-US bilateral ties.""Trump's 'America First' strategy has the potential to damage the US-India relationship. He should instead strengthen India's alliance to cope up with the challenges posed by China,"" Mr Tellis, a senior fellow South Asia Programme at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a top American think-tank, said in an article.Mumbai-born Ashley Tellis, 55, in an op-ed published in Asia Policy by the National Bureau of Asian Research, said, the variety of positions expressed by Trump suggests that the potential threat to the continuing transformation of US-India relations comes less from his views on India- which are probably unsettled- than it does from his iconoclastic convictions about the relationship between the US and the world.He argues that while many elements of Trump's nationalist agenda are understandable - even defensible - the worldview it represents diverges from that which initially cultured the evolving US-Indian partnership.""Going back to the earliest years of the George W Bush administration, the US' rapprochement with India was premised on the assumption that the principle strategic problem facing both countries consisted of the rise of China and the threat it posed to both US primacy and Indian security- not to mention the safety of the US' other Asian partner and allies - simultaneously,"" he wrote.. ""Since it was assumed that the United States would subsist as the principal protector of the liberal international order, and the Western alliance system in particular, even in circumstances where the containment of China was impossible because of the new realities of economic interdependence, the Bush administration slowly gravitated toward a strategy of balancing China by building up the power of key states located on its periphery,"" Mr Tellis said.He says the current US commitment to the rise of Indian power sans symmetric reciprocity was devised during the Bush administration but has been faithfully continued by President Barack Obama for very good reasons.It was anchored in the presumption that helping India expand in power and prosperity served the highest geopolitical interests of the US in Asia and globally-namely, maintaining a balance of power that advantaged the liberal democracies, he said.""Accordingly, it justified acts of extraordinary US generosity toward India, even if specific policies emanating from New Delhi did not always dovetail with Washington's preferences,"" Mr Tellis said in the article.""Given that what India could become -a power capable of successfully balancing a rising China- mattered more for US interests than what New Delhi did on any other issue, US policy for almost two decades has embodied a calculated altruism whereby Washington continually seeks to bolster India's national capabilities without any expectations of direct recompense,"" he said.Tellis warns that if New Delhi fails to satisfy the anticipation of reciprocity embodied by an America-first policy -a likely prospect given India's resource and power constraints - both nations will have ended up worse off. ""Without the benefit of a preferential affiliation with the US, India's challenges with regard to managing a rising China (and even a troublesome Pakistan) will have become considerably more difficult,"" he said. CommentsClose  X ""The United States in turn will have lost the opportunity to preserve an advantageous Asian balance of power, which by incorporating a strengthened India actually constrains Chinese ambitions and thereby buttresses US primacy for more time to come,"" Mr Tellis added.

CSIS in its report recommends that the US and India should deepen announced efforts on submarine safety and anti-submarine warfare to include combined training and exercises to expand the capability of both countries as well as their inter-operability with each other.Seeking to increase the FDI limit in the defence sector to 100 per cent, the report also calls for strengthening and expanding the homeland security dialogue.The think-tank recommends the new president should invite India to participate (as an observer or stakeholder) in the Quadrilateral Coordination Group talks with the Taliban.It also urges for establishing a US-India dialogue on the Middle East, modeled on the ""East Asia Consults"" of the US State Department and India's Ministry of External Affairs.CSIS said PM Modi's emergence as a strong leader, just as the US was seeking to consolidate its strategy of re-balance to the Asia Pacific, gave America an opportunity to engage with a rising leader in India, and India an opportunity to reprioritise and rethink its engagement with the world. CommentsClose  X President Obama continues a bipartisan run of three presidents who have seen India as key to US strategy in Asia, it said.Observing that President Obama has built a strong relationship with PM Modi, and maintained a high tempo of engagements at the highest levels, the report said the US engagement with India has increasingly focused on the security aspects and India has responded with uncharacteristic warmth to this outreach.

""It was a privilege to do business with Indian counterparts then, and it has been my great honour this year to work with Indian leaders as Secretary of State. I look forward to returning to Delhi next week, for the first time in my official capacity,"" Tillerson said.Referring to the fact that earlier this month, a shipment of American crude oil arrived in India, Tillerson said it was a tangible illustration of India and the US expanding their energy cooperation.The Trump Administration is determined to dramatically deepen ways for the US and India to work together, he asserted.Noting that more than 600 American companies operate in India, Tillerson said the US foreign direct investment has jumped by 500 per cent in the past two years alone.The bilateral trade hit a record of roughly $115 billion last year, a number US plans to increase, he said.

NDTV,India,Washington,Indian-Americans Protest Against CNN Over 'Negative' Portrayal Of Hinduism In Documentary,"Many Indian-Americans turned up at the CNN office in downtown Chicago to protest against a documentary they allege portrayed Hinduism in a negative light.

""The documentary aired by CNN portrayed Hinduism in a negative light. This is now what Hinduism is all about,"" said Bharat Barai, an eminent Indian-American from Chicago area who attended the peaceful protest against CNN in front of its Chicago office.

Several hundred Indian-Americans turned up for the protest rally, braving light rain. Barai alleged that the CNN documentary on Hinduism produced by special reporter Reza Aslan showed practices of five Aghori Bawas.


""This was his picture of Hinduism projected to the world on CNN,"" said a protest letter distributed on the occasion.

""The grotesque practices of five individuals have nothing to do with Hinduism, they are not part of any Hindu scriptures or Hindu teachings,"" Mr Barai said.

Hindu-American groups from across the country have held several protests against the CNN after the airing of the documentary on March 5, including New York, Washington, Houston, Atlanta, San Francisco and Los Angeles. This was the largest protest so far.

Vamsee Juluri, an Indian-American professor of Media studies at the University of San Francisco called the show ""reckless, racist and dangerously anti-immigrant"".


Pointing out several inaccuracies, mistranslations and mis-characterisations in the show he said, ""It is one saddening reality that despite having had immigrants in America for so many decades now, a major news channel like CNN still cannot do better than the old Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom sort of story when it comes to India"".

""Far from wanting to experience any spirituality within Hinduism, Reza Aslan seems to have gone to India only to confirm his Orientalist biases,"" said Chandrashekar Wagh from the Coalition Against Hinduphobia.

In a statement posted on Facebook, Mr Aslan said his documentary is not about Hinduism, but about Aghori, a mystical Hindu sect known for extreme rituals.

Mr Aslan said there are people who are offended by the episode, especially when it comes to its treatment of such issues as caste discrimination, which remains a touchy subject for many Hindus in America."

First Post,India,Jaipur,US National Defence Strategy 2018 a great opportunity for India to turn bilateral cooperation with Washington into strategic alliance,"The Donald Trump administration unveiled the 2018 National Defence Strategy (NDS) for the United States. This is the first new NDS in almost a decade; the previous one was brought out in 2008. The new NDS reflects the US military's interpretation of how it will follow through on the Trump administration's National Security Strategy (NSS), that had outlined the major threats facing the US and how the executive branch of the government plans to counter them. The NDS has put countering China and Russia at the core of America's new priorities, just like the NSS had done last month. By listing China and Russia as paramount security threats to the US, the document signals a hardening of resolve by Washington. Releasing an unclassified summary of the NDS document, the Pentagon criticised the two countries for trying to ""shape a world consistent with their authoritarian model — gaining veto authority over other nations' economic, diplomatic and security decisions"".
For Elbridge Colby, deputy assistant secretary of defence for strategy and force development, the new strategy ""really represents a fundamental shift to say, look, we have to get back, in a sense, to the basics of the potential for war, and this strategy says the focus will be on prioritising preparedness for war, in particular, major power war"". In a clear sign of shifting US priorities, Defence Secretary Jim Mattis said in a speech, presenting the strategy document, that the US will ""continue to prosecute the campaign against terrorists that we are engaged in today, but great power competition, not terrorism, is now the primary focus of US national security"".
This assertion echoes what the NDS has argued: ""We are facing increased global disorder, characterised by decline in the long-standing rules-based international order — creating a security environment more complex and volatile than any we have experienced in recent memory. Inter-state strategic competition, not terrorism, is now the primary concern in US national security.""

China, identified in the document as a ""strategic competitor"", has been accused of leveraging military modernisation, influence operations and predatory economics to coerce neighbouring countries to reorder the Indo-Pacific region to China's advantage. In order to push back against that narrative, the Chinese defence ministry has asked the US to abandon the ""Cold War"" and ""zero-sum"" mindset.
Last week, Beijing said that China will take ""necessary measures"" to safeguard its sovereignty in the South China Sea after a US missile destroyer entered the disputed Huangyan Island, also known as Scarborough Shoal, and claimed by the Philippines as well as China. The US often criticises China for militarising South China Sea by constructing artificial islands and military installations, saying they could be used for restricting ""freedom of navigation"".
Russia too has been singled out for shattering the North American Treaty Organisation (NATO) while altering ""European and Middle East security and economic structures"" to its advantage and making ""use of emerging technologies to discredit and subvert democratic processes in Georgia, Crimea, and eastern Ukraine"".
Predictably, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov lambasted the US for using an unnecessarily confrontational approach, saying, ""It is regrettable that instead of having a normal dialogue, instead of using the basis of international law, the US is striving to prove its leadership through such confrontational strategies and concepts.""
The heavy emphasis on China and Russia does not mean the US would take its eyes off other threats such as Iran, North Korea, Islamic State or terrorism. The new NDS has listed North Korea among the priority areas, emphasising the need to focus American missile defences against the threat from Pyongyang. Iran is also identified as the most significant challenge to Middle East stability.""
Though the State actors would need to be countered, non-State actors such as Islamist militants would also pose threats.
This is an era of great strategic uncertainties and complex global challenges; the Trump administration is seen withdrawing from US' global commitments as reflected in its decisions to demand renegotiation of the Iran nuclear deal, to withdraw the US from the Paris Climate Accord, to question US' commitment to NATO, to abandon the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), to criticise the United Nations as being irrelevant, to name just a few. The administration's 'America First' rhetoric seems to suggest that Washington might turn its back on America's indispensable role in sustaining the global economic and security order created after the Second World War.
Notwithstanding the infamously inconsistent president, there are notable policy continuities as well in the defence document. In particular, secretary Jim Mattis has been a sobering influence on setting the administration's long-term strategic priorities for the US. Mattis usually keeps a low public profile and tenaciously circumvents issues where his approach might be seen as at cross purposes with that of Trump's. Thus, Mattis' ownership of the NDS makes it a worthy document, where he has sought to balance competing priorities.
Mattis reportedly did not agree with Trump's unexpected decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel capital and eventually move the US embassy there. Not surprisingly, the decision triggered intense backlash from US' allies. Mattis has publicly stated that the Pentagon must prepare for climate change, while Trump has repeatedly expressed scepticism about it. The new NDS also does not mention climate change as a threat, an obvious concession to Trump. But one of the principal rhetorical departures of Mattis from Trump is his firm focus on reassuring allies how much the US relies on them. If Trump has termed the NATO as ""obsolete"", Mattis firmly believes that the US would strengthen its traditional alliances while building new partnerships.
The new documents lamented ""the erosion of US military advantage vis-a-vis China and Russia, which, if unaddressed, could ultimately undermine our ability to deter aggression and coercion and imperil the free and open order that we seek to underwrite with our alliance constellation"".
This makes two things amply clear. First, international alliances are critical for the US military, even though there is a need for burden-sharing, an apparent reference to Trump's public criticism of allies who are seen as unfairly taking advantage of US security guarantees. Second, the US military is going to refocus on fighting other nations, implying manufacturing new weapons and equipments and embracing innovations so it reaches the battlefield faster. As Mattis said, ""We cannot expect success fighting tomorrow's conflicts with yesterday's weapons or equipment.""
This must be seen as a great opportunity for India's defense establishment which will have to think out-of-the-box on how to make a pitch for joint manufacturing of new age weapons.
The new strategy touches upon a range of other issues, including ongoing military operations in Afghanistan. For the Trump administration, the major challenge in South Asia is to stabilise conflict-ridden Afghanistan, and India is considered as a valuable partner in this herculean effort. In his famous speech for Afghanistan in August last year, Trump had said that the ""critical part of the South Asia strategy for America is to further develop its strategic partnership with India — the world's largest democracy and a key security and economic partner of the US"".
The increased India-US cooperation should be viewed in the context of increasingly complex challenges being faced by Washington in the evolving Afghan scenario. Evidently, the new strategy marks a shift from the Pentagon’s two-war doctrine — the idea that the US military must be prepared to fight two major regional conflicts simultaneously. Now the areas to be defended are three.
The document commits the US military to ""strengthen our alliances and partnerships in the Indo-Pacific to a networked security architecture capable of deterring aggression, maintaining stability, and ensuring free access to common domains"".
Without mentioning India, it maintains that ""with key countries in the region, we will bring together bilateral and multilateral security relationships to preserve the free and open international system"". The transformational prospects for India-US ties are in the Indo-Pacific region where the US perceives a growing threat from China. This approach is in alignment with the Modi government's strategy towards China. It is no secret that India-China relations have seen considerable deterioration with Beijing tightening its grip in the South Asian region, which India considers its natural sphere of influence. With both India and China jostling with each other for greater strategic space, the bilateral relationship is set for a bumpy road ahead.
At a time when Beijing is attempting to expand its military and political influence under the aegis of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the efforts to prevent the emergence of a Sino-centric Asian order, antithetical to the rules-based international order, assume far greater significance. Thus, in the midst of a visible decline in Western-led global institutions and an assertive China, the deepening of Indo-US strategic partnership is likely to help New Delhi expand its influence and presence not only in India's extended neighbourhood but also in the Indo-Pacific region.
The Trump administration has taken significant steps to make India a crucial partner in its plans for Indo-Pacific region, where the US has always been a principal architect and the traditional guarantor of a liberal economic and maritime order.
We can expect the Trump administration to continue to empower India, designated by the US as a ""major defence partner"", to fulfil its ""indispensable role in maintaining stability in the Indian Ocean region"". The prospects seem bright for enhanced cooperation between the US, India, Japan and Australia, on matters of regional security. "
First Post,India,,"H-1B visa: US lacks skilled talent, can't afford en masse deportation of Indian IT employees, says Mohandas Pai","If the proposed change in H-1B visas come into force, around 5-7 lakh Indians could be sent home. The move could directly stop hundreds of thousands of foreign workers from keeping their H-1B visas while their green card applications are pending. However, IT industry veteran Mohandas Pai demolishes that fear as a myth, stating that the move would hurt the US more because it ""simply does not have the talent for the IT sector like India has"".

In his bid to stay true to his campaign promise of “Buy American, Hire American"", boost manufacturing and protect local jobs for Americans, US President Donald Trump is considering new regulations aimed at preventing the extension of H-1B visas, predominantly used by Indian IT professionals. Pai believes Trump is trying to reduce the 'backlog' of visa applications. “Most people who are on an H-1B visa extension and applying for the green card are employees of American MNCs (multinational companies). There are very few from the Indian IT workforce who would want an extension,” he says.
However, a media report quoting the Pew Research Center report said that the proposed changes in H-1B visas would have a dramatic effect, particularly on India considering more than half of all H-1B visas have been awarded to Indian nationals. Pai believes Indian IT professionals who are working on projects in the US are keen only on work visas. If the Trump administration does not extend their visas, senior and high-quality talent will take a beating and that would detrimental to US companies, he says.

Not just the US companies but also their politicians would be affected. Pai believes that they would lobby against it, and that would be good as it may lead to a reform in the green card issuance process.
""We are not sending cheap labour to the US. Our IT talent comprises of highly talented people. They cannot be replaced,"" Pai said.

The US has a skill gap with over 2 million STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) jobs lying vacant, of which one million is in the IT sector, Nasscom president R Chandrasekhar told the Times of India.
If the new visa regulations come into force, the US tech industry will also be affected by the shortage of skilled professionals in the country. Tech firms in the US depend on the H-1B visas to hire tens of thousands of workforce each year from countries like India and China.
""All this goes to show the deep shortage of skilled professionals in the IT sector,"" says Pai, adding that not extending H-1B visas would hurt the US more.
Though the chances of IT professionals being deported en masse is a remote possibility, Pai recommends ""wait and watch"" approach. But even if they are deported, their return, he believes, will not impact company bottom lines negatively.
“The talent has valuable experience and companies will not let them go. The US companies hire Indian tech talent paying $125,000 to $150,000 per year. Why would they pay that kind of money to hire people from abroad if they could get this talent within? The US simply does not have the talent for the IT sector like India has,"" adds Pai."
First Post,India,,Donald Trump's National Security Strategy indicates shift in US view of India and Pakistan over two years,"The Trump administration — and more specifically, the man at the helm of it — has been talking tough on Pakistan ever since it took over in January this year. For instance, in August, when the US approved a $255-million aid package for Pakistan (having provided nearly $33 billion since 2002), Trump said, ""We can no longer be silent about Pakistan’s safe havens for terrorist organisations, the Taliban, and other groups that pose a threat to the region and beyond... We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting. But that will have to change, and that will change immediately."" Secretary of State Rex Tillerson added, ""We’re going to be conditioning our support for Pakistan and our relationship with them on them delivering results in this area.""
With that in mind, it's unsurprising to see the sort of language used in various public utterances manifest itself on the pages of the NSS. For the near future, it looks like this public war of words between Islamabad and Washington will continue... largely in the press. Trump or a member of his Cabinet will fire off a salvo at Pakistan. Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif or Janjua or someone else will return fire. Frostiness will reign supreme and then a bilateral visit by a secretary or minister will smooth things over until the next salvo. Will this iteration of the NSS make a difference to Pakistan's relationship with terrorism emanating from its own soil? Hard to be certain, but for now, it seems rather unlikely.
What all this means for India is very different. It would be easy for New Delhi to thumb its nose at China — that took a bit of stick in the NSS — and pat itself on the back about how mighty it has become on the world stage that even the US acknowledges its majesty and gives it the proverbial bhaav. Unfortunately, it looks like the reality is very far removed from this interpretation.
Admittedly, Trump — or his NSS at the very least — acknowledges India as a leader and a partner. However, the lines about India that follow and a cursory reading of the rest of the document indicate that there are three clear areas (and one slightly fuzzy one) in which the US now needs India:
First, as a part of the US strategy to counter China: The references to leadership in the region, New Delhi's growing relationships in the region and quadrilateral cooperation make this part very clear. Washington is wary of Beijing's growing clout and using New Delhi as its 'guy on the inside' will ostensibly help the US 'contain' China, particularly in the South China Sea, without getting its own hands too dirty.
Second, as a part of the US strategy to curb terrorism emanating from Pakistan: All that talk of regional and global leadership when read alongside the lines on Pakistan indicate that the US is not too pleased with Pakistan. And by demonstrating this state of displeasure while talking up India — all publicly, the document gives the impression that Washington has picked a side. In doing so, the effort could be to embolden India to carry on with its actions against Pakistan. Once again, this would save the US the effort of actually getting its hands dirty.
Third, the allusion to India's economic assistance in the region clearly refers to Afghanistan: New Delhi and Kabul share cordial, if not outright warm, relations and Washington is not unaware. The US drawdown from Afghanistan has been a nightmare that keeps on giving (grief, that is) and costing American taxpayers millions every year. What better way than to pull out of yet another botched endgame in that country than by getting a willing neighbour to foot the bill?
And the fuzzy fourth, three references to the India-US defence partnership in a document that is fairly critical of Russia, could hint at Trump's willingness to take Moscow (New Delhi's largest source of arms imports over the years) out of the game by striking better defence deals with India. Despite still having a great deal of warmth and positivity, the India-Russia relationship is at its lowest point since Independence. Could the US be planning to replace Russia in India's mind space? Perhaps, but it's far too early to even contemplate the remotest notion of all that.
Of course, there is the fact that India is obviously not going to unquestioningly and obediently follow the US' instructions on foreign policy. But, the NSS is a good indicator of the roles Washington sees other countries playing. To sum it all up, it's true that there's been a major shift in the way the US perceives of India — Washington sees New Delhi as a far more useful player in its game than ever before. It is still too premature and extreme to use the word 'pawn' just yet."
First Post,India,Hyderabad:,"India-US relationship will 'scale new heights' under Narendra Modi-Donald Trump leadership, says Sushma Swaraj","External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj said the relationship between India and the US under the current leadership will scale new heights and contribute to global peace and prosperity.
The minister said this while proposing a vote of thanks at the inaugural session of the Global Entrepreneur Summit 2017, which among others was attended by Ivanka Trump, US president Donald Trump's daughter and advisor to the White House.

""I have no doubt that under leadership of prime minister (Narendra) Modi and President Trump, India and US relations will scale new heights and contribute to global peace and prosperity,"" she said. The minister also underlined the need for according priority to women entrepreneurship, saying it should be a priority for India as well as the rest of the world. She further said that while India is a land of entrepreneurs, the US is a nation that is identified with spirit of enterprise.

""The relationship between the two countries have developed into a partnership of global significance. Woman entrepreneurs are epitome of courage and leadership. Empowerment of women is priority for India and should be a priority for entire world,"" Swaraj said.
She added that the government has embarked upon ambitious programme of empowerment of women and skill development.
Further, the minister said Ivanka Trump represents the energy and spirit of entrepreneurship that characterised youth of today.

""We appreciate efforts by the US government to promote entrepreneurship globally. We deeply value strong desire of President Trump to further strengthen partnership with India which we fully share,"" Swaraj said.

First Post,India,,"H-1B visa, Pakistan dominate Rex Tillerson and Sushma Swaraj's talks; India, US agree to strengthen bilateral ties","Welcoming Tillerson on his maiden visit to India as US Secretary of State, Modi noted with appreciation the firm upward trajectory in the bilateral strategic partnership following ""positive and far-reaching talks"" with US president Donald Trump in Washington in June this year, according to a statement issued by the Prime Minister's Office (PMO).
""The prime minister shared the resolve expressed by secretary Tillerson on taking further steps in the direction of accelerating and strengthening the content, pace and scope of bilateral engagement,"" the PMO statement said.
""They affirmed that a strengthened India-US partnership is not just of mutual benefit to both countries, but has significant positive impact on the prospects for regional and global stability and prosperity as well,"" it stated.
In the context of President Trump's new South Asia strategy unveiled in August, Modi noted the commonality of objectives like eradicating terrorist infrastructure, safe havens and support, while bringing peace and stability to Afghanistan.
H-1B visas
India also raised the issue of H-1B visas with the US. ""We discussed the significant contributions to the US economy made by skilled Indian professionals holding H-1B and L1 visas,"" Sushma Swaraj said in a joint address to the media.
""I have also sought cooperation from Tillerson to address the pending issues related to totalisation, and urged him that the US should not do anything that will hurt Indian interests,"" she said.
Trump had called for stricter norms for issue of H-1B visas, largely availed by Indian IT firms.
A private member's bill was introduced earlier in 2017 in the US Congress by Democrat Zoe Lofgren seeking to increase the minimum salary of an H-1B visa holder to $130,000 from the current minimum of $60,000.
While Trump has spoken of restricting the H-1B visa system as part of his policy of putting 'America first', there have been no changes to it so far. This year, the same levels of 65,000 for general H-1B visas and 20,000 for those with advanced US degrees have been maintained. Indians get most of the H-1B visas, although there are no national quotas for the facility.
Replying to a question, Swaraj said that while there had been no changes made to the H-1B rules yet, if a private member's bill in the US Congress got passed, Indian professionals would be impacted. ""H-1B rules can be changed either by an executive order (issued by the US president) or by the US Congress, and we are talking to both sides,"" she said.
Terror havens

Keeping the heat on Pakistan and with an eye on a rapidly rising China, India and the US said that Islamabad should immediately take steps to finish terror organisations and terrorist safe havens on its soil. The two countries also agreed to work together for security in the India-Pacific region.


Tillerson and Swaraj also agreed that US president Donald Trump's new Afghanistan policy would be effective only if Pakistan takes action against terror groups on its soil. ""We discussed the issue of terrorism at length. This is a big threat for the whole world. We also discussed implementing President Trump's new Afghanistan and South Asia policies, so that it can achieve the desired results,"" Swaraj said.

""We expressed serious concerns over the situation in Afghanistan. It proves that even today there are elements providing safe havens and support to terrorists. We agreed that we need to ensure that no country does this,"" she said.
She said nations supporting terror should be held accountable. ""We also agreed that Pakistan should take immediate steps to finish the safe havens on its soil. We believe President Trump's new policy can be successful only when Pakistan acts against all terror groups,"" Swaraj said.
Tillerson, who flew in from Pakistan after bluntly telling Islamabad that it must increase its efforts to eradicate militants and terrorists operating within the country, said India ""plays an important role"" in Trump's new South Asia strategy, which doubles American commitment to peace and stability in the region.
""In the fight against terrorism, the United States will continue to stand shoulder to shoulder with India. Terror safe havens will not be tolerated,"" he said.
Cooperation in India-Pacific region
Tillerson said his country will continue to contribute to Indian capabilities to provide security throughout the region.
Swaraj confirmed that the India-Pacific region came in for intense discussion in Wednesday's talks. ""We discussed the importance of freedom of navigation, overflights and unhindered trade under international rules and norms for a sovereign and developed India-Pacific region,"" she stated.
Stating that US supports India's emergence as a leading power in South Asia, Tillerson said the two countries will cooperate further to promote rules-based commerce, in remarks apparently targetting China over its growing belligerence in the South China Sea.
""We look forward to furthering cooperation in the broader India-Pacific region as we both promote a rules-based approach to commerce and a transparent and sustainable approach to economic development. We are glad to be joined in this effort by our close mutual partner Japan,"" he said.
His visit comes a week after he made a speech in Washington on the US wanting to ""dramatically deepen"" cooperation with India.
North Korea
The issue of North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programme also came up, and in reply to a question as to whether India was ready to cut off diplomatic ties with Pyongyang, Sushma Swaraj said that trade relations with that East Asian nation are at a minimum, but it is important to continue having an embassy in North Korea to keep communication channels open.
""As far as the question of embassy goes, our embassy there is very small, but there is in fact an embassy. India and North Korea maintain diplomatic offices in each other's capitals, though New Delhi recently banned trade of most goods with the country, except food and medicine. Trade is minimal,"" Swaraj said."
First Post,India,,"US pressure on India to grant more patents on pharma products 'appalling', say health advocates","Top health advocates have called the attempt by the US to pressure India to grant additional patents on drugs and vaccines as “appalling” and are writing a letter to a US lawmaker to register their protest. On 23 June, four American lawmakers including Richard Neal (D-MA), Kevin Brady (R-TX), Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Orrin Hatch wrote to US president Donald Trump to use the then-impending Indian prime minister Narendra Modi’s Washington visit to address New Delhi’s ""inadequate"" protection of patents, trademarks and copyrights, and the ""arbitrary"" style of pricing medical products.
The letter points out that India accounts for less than two percent of total US exports of goods and services — ""(I)f tariff and investment restrictions were fully eliminated (by India) and standards of IP protection were made comparable to US and western European levels, US exports to India would rise by two-thirds, and US investment in India would roughly double,"" the letter reads referencing an American international trade report.
""India’s weak standards and insufficient enforcement remain an area of concern for US rightholders, including with respect to pharmaceutical patents and in the area of copyright protection…,"" the letter adds. It also criticises the government’s decision to cap prices for coronary stents.

""Moreover, India has imposed additional barriers in 2017. One such example is the expansion of India’s nontransparent and arbitrary system of pricing on medical products, recently expanded to include coronary stents.""
""According to some US producers, India’s arbitrary system has forced them to sell certain products at a loss in order to retain access to the Indian market,"" the senators and representatives complained.
To recall, leaked diplomatic cables last year by Knowledge Ecology International (KEI), a non-profit working on drug patents, showed that Colombian officials were worried after a conversation with a staffer from Hatch’s office about the potentially negative impact of US funding for the Colombian peace process should Colombia issue compulsory licences for producing cheaper versions of a cancer drug manufactured by Novartis.
Colombia, nevertheless, went ahead and reduced the price of the drug Imatinib by 44 percent.
On 26 June, Trump, in his joint statement in the White House with Modi, sought ""to create a trading relationship that is fair and reciprocal"".
""It is important that barriers be removed to the export of US goods into your markets, and that we reduce our trade deficit with your country,"" Trump said.
Their respective teams will look into ""creative ways to improve bilateral trade"", the joint statement added.
""Modi has already bowed to pressure from (former US president Barack) Obama on granting compulsory licenses on cancer drug patents. He leads a country of more than a billion people, ?and he should not sacrifice their health and their lives of people in India to gain the affection of an unpopular US president who has the attention span of a six-year-old,"" Jamie Love, director of KEI, told Firstpost in an email interview.
""The United States is paying too much, and so does everyone else, just not to the degree that the US gets ripped off. What Trump and Modi should focus on is a new trade framework that focuses on sharing the costs of funding research and development as a public good,"" he added.
The US Trade Representative’s Special 301 report — a Congressionally-mandated annual report that has been issued every year beginning in 1989 — puts India under the 'Priority Watch List' for its ""serious intellectual property rights deficiencies"".
In response to the American lawmakers’ appeal to Trump, a number of top health advocates are sending a letter to Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, that they ""are surprised and dismayed that you are pressuring India to grant additional patents on drugs and vaccines"".
In 2015, the income per capita of India was 35 times lower than the per capita of the US.

""A country with as much poverty as India should not enforce patents on drugs and vaccines the same way as high-income industrialised countries,"" the letter further states.
India is a ""critically important? source"" of affordable generic products in many developed and developing countries.

""The practical effect of the type of trade pressures you advocate is to enhance the monopoly power and raise the prices of new drugs for cancer and many other diseases. This is appalling,"" it adds.
The recently-released draft reform healthcare bill wants foreign countries to pay more for medicines through directing American executive agencies to review all multilateral and bilateral agreements for greater IP protection and possible enforcement options in case of violations, and to review other countries’ supply and procurement systems and price differentials.
""The implication of the proposed actions to force higher drug prices on other countries is that Big Pharma would take it easy on US consumers and payers. To date, there is no evidence of any such price moderation by Big Pharma either on existing or new medicines despite much stronger IP protections in multiple bilateral, regional, and multilateral trade agreements since the 1990’s,” wrote Brook K Baker, professor at Northeastern University School of Law, in his blog on 23 June.
Trump’s draft executive order on healthcare is an issue of fierce debate in the US with a Congressional report estimating that 22 million Americans would lose insurance by 2026 should this bill be passed.
""As the draft executive order shows, Trump wants to make foreign countries pay more for medicine, even though that will do nothing to make medicines more accessible in the United States, and exorbitant prices already cost lives around the world,"" said Peter Maybarduk, director of Public Citizen’s Access to Medicines Program on 27 June in a press statement.
Meanwhile, in a World Trade Organisation’s Council for TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) meeting on 13 June, India along with Brazil, China, Fiji and South Africa tabled a first-of-its-kind proposal that called on governments to examine the growing concern of ""imbalance between intellectual property and the public interest"".
It asked member States to hold dialogue ""on measures within the IP system that they have adopted to promote the public interest, including but not limited to compulsory licensing, patentability criteria, IP and competition, and the Bolar exception"".
The flexibilities within TRIPS allow governments to tailor their national IP laws within the minimum standards set by the TRIPS agreement taking into account their developmental needs, including public health interests. However, a September 2016 report of the UN Secretary-General’s High-Level Panel on Access to Medicines shows that many governments are reluctant to use these flexibilities, including issuing compulsory licenses, for various reasons that include undue political and economic pressure from powerful governments and corporations.
India has used this flexibility only once in March 2012 when Indian generic manufacturer NATCO Pharma was granted compulsory license to manufacture Bayer’s drug Sorafenib Tosylate (Nexavar) used for the treatment of kidney and liver cancer.
""Political and economic pressure placed on governments to forgo the use of TRIPS flexibilities violates the integrity and legitimacy of the system of legal duties and rights created by the TRIPS agreement and as reaffirmed by the Doha Declaration,"" India had said in a statement to the TRIPS meeting of 13 June.
""Patent rights cannot be allowed to impede protection of public health,"" it said.
It also invited Colombia to share its experience of covert threats from ""domestic and foreign parties"" when it was to issue a compulsory license on Imatinib.
The Trump administration has made IP rights one of its topmost priorities ""and conflated it with the issue of big-ticket investments in India"", a Hindu report citing sources said.
Issues around patent protection and affordability of health products is one of the trickiest sticking points in India-US bilateral relations."
First Post,India,,Narendra Modi’s US visit underplayed issues of diaspora; tiptoeing Donald Trump could push away Indian caucus,"As Indian-American Professor Amit Gupta reminds this author, always, there are five India-US relationships: the government to government relationship; the military to military relationship, the one between Bengaluru and Silicon Valley; the one between Indian students and American universities; and finally, the one between Indian Diaspora and India.

Of these, the first two are the ones on which the Indian government pins the most hopes, but these are also the most problematic. In fact, relationships at the political and military level — having grown considerably over the recent years — seem to have plateaued somewhat. For instance, the much-talked-about cooperation in the purchase and investment of defence material has its obvious limitations, given the fact that India is in the minor leagues for American manufacturers compared to Saudi Arabia which has inked a deal for $110 billion in arms. Besides, when one talks of US investment in Indian defence sector, it should be realised that the investible resources are in the US private sectors, which, in turn, make their own judgments of where to invest, depending on the recipient country’s infrastructure, legal regime, administrative machinery, and above all, broad political consensus on liberalisation of the economy. And here, India is not up to the mark. There is another limiting factor: the present inabilities of India’s arms industries to absorb the technologies that foreign companies are prepared to transfer.


However, the other three parameters of the India-US relationship are extremely important and have tremendous potential to bring the countries closer since they are less complicated. Unfortunately, under the Trump presidency, there are serious question marks over them, but the Trump-Modi parleys don't seem to have taken care of them properly.
Broadly speaking, the relation between Bengaluru and Silicon Valley, the one between Indian students and American universities and the one between Indian Diaspora and India imply that there are free interflows of finance, technology and people between India and the United States. But that is precisely in jeopardy today with the Trump Administration imposing restrictions on issuing H1B visas for the high-skilled Indians, discouraging American companies from investing abroad under the plea of generating jobs for Americans in America, and finally, not doing enough to prevent racial attacks on the lives and properties of Indians or those of Indian origin living in the United States. Trump’s immigration policies and the spate of attacks on Indians in the recent months are undoubtedly making things complicated.
It may be noted that the nearly 2.5 million-strong Indian diaspora in the US — consisting of people of Indian origin (PIO) and non-resident Indians including students, professors, scientists, technologists — may comprise about one percent of the total American population, but it is one of the richest and highly skilled population in that country.
The PIOs and NRIs in the US stand for more than five percent of America’s scientists, engineers, and software specialists; they also account for 10% of the doctors. They are successful in the fields of engineering and law as well. As high as 35% of Boeing’s technical work force is said to be of Indian origin. In the Silicon Valley, 15 percent of the start-ups are held by Indian-Americans, who, between them, produce IT assets of around $300 billion per year.
A study in the year 2010 showed the average per capita income of an Indian-American to be around $88,000, much higher than that of all Asian Americans ($66,000) and all US households ($49,800). This figure, which might have gone up in the last seven years, is not surprising, given the high education levels of the Indian diaspora. According to Pew Research Centre (PRC), 40.6% of Indian Americans aged 25 and above have graduate or professional degrees, 32.3% have bachelor’s degrees; and an additional 10.4% have some college education. The corresponding figures among the overall US population are much lower.

One likely factor for the above is the fact that most of the Indians migrating to the United States are already well educated. Many of them enter the country under the H1-B visa programme that allows highly skilled foreign workers in designated ""specialty occupations"" to work in the US.
In fact, some estimates suggest that 70% of the 85,000 H-1B visas awarded annually go to Indians. Even otherwise, according to the US State Department, as of November 2016, more than 3.3 lakh of the 40 lakh applications on the waiting list for permanent residency were Indians. Trump has vowed to rein in this trend.

It is true that Modi’s latest trip to the US resulted in India’s formal entry into the International Expedited Traveler Initiative (Global Entry programme) in order to facilitate closer business and educational ties between the citizens of India and the United States, something that has been mentioned in the ""Joint Statement — United States and India: Prosperity Through Partnership"" issued on 27 June. But that should not detract us from the fact that this will facilitate expedited clearance only for pre-approved and low-risk travellers upon arrival in the United States through automatic kiosks at select airports. The issue involved here is the increasing restrictions on getting visa, not hassle-free entry into the US after getting visa.
It may be noted that it is in the Indian diaspora in the United States that India has a powerful constituency to influence American decision makers for strengthening the ties between New Delhi and Washington. And when this ""constituency"" of India is not given its due importance by the Trump administration, it is a matter of concern.
Why is it so?
If PRC is to be believed, 65% of Indian Americans are Democrats or leaned toward the Democrats, making them an Asian-American subgroup most likely to identify with the Democratic Party or traditionally voting for the Democrats. It is not that there are no Indian American Republicans; there are the likes of Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal and governor-turned-ambassador to the United Nations (a cabinet-rank post in the American system) Nikki Haley. In fact, some reports suggest that as Indian Americans have become wealthier, they are becoming more conservative and are leaning towards the Republican Party, evident from their increasing financial contribution to the Republican Party in recent years. But overall, more Indian-Americans are Democrats, possibly to the disliking of Trump.
Secondly, it is also a fact that only about half (51%) of Indian Americans are Hindu, according to a 2012 survey by PRC. In this study, 18% of Indian Americans identified themselves as Christians and 10% said they were Muslim. This religious denomination could be important as non-Hindus in the Indian diaspora may not like the frequent reports of discrimination and harassment of minorities in India under Modi. And that being the case, the Indian diaspora may not work that sincerely and powerfully to generate a favourable climate of opinion in the US Congress, approve pro-India legislations and defeat anti-India measures through “India caucus” there, as was the case in the past (for example, Kargil War and India-US nuclear deal).
All this is not to suggest that things are going downhill as far as the overall India-US relations are concerned. The relationship does enjoy ample bipartisan support in Washington. Yet, the fact remains that not everything is smooth sailing in this supposedly safe relationship at the moment."
First Post,India,Washington,"Mike Pence to visit India soon, says US-India ties have 'never looked brighter'","Vice President Mike Pence has said he is planning to visit India soon and asserted that the Indo-US partnership has never looked brighter with the best days for the two nations yet to come.
Describing Prime Minister Narendra Modi's meeting with US President Donald Trump as ""historic and productive"", Pence said, ""Today I say with confidence that our friendship would grow and deepen.""
Addressing the top business executives of the United States, Pence appeared to be very enthusiastic about the future of the ties between the US and India, which he said can work together for the development, peace and prosperity of the two countries and the world. Pence was addressing the 42nd annual gala of the US-India Business Council (USIBC), the top industry advocacy body of American businesses having a footprint in India.
Recollecting Trump's remarks at the Rose Garden in White House on Tuesday, Pence said, ""India has a true friend at the White House"" and so do all the businesses that have gathered at the event.
""This is an exciting time between the US and India. As President Trump said, the future of our partnership has never looked brighter,"" Pence said on Tuesday.
Pence also had a one-on-one meeting with Modi at the White House on Monday. Pence, who had earlier been the governor of Indiana, told the business executives that Modi told him that ""India-Ana means coming to India"", with the comment drawing a laud applause from the audience.
Pence said he has accepted the prime minister's invitation to visit India. ""I was very humbled when the Prime Minister Modi extended a personal invitation to me to represent the United States. And we're already making plans to take it up on his invitation,"" Pence said.
When he was the governor of Indiana, Pence said, he had plans to take a business delegation to India, which he could not do because of the last year's general elections.
But now, he said he was hoping to visit India soon. ""The bottom line is that the United States and India can deepen our commercial bond in many industries and areas,"" he said.

Pence said the US' relationship with India is one of the most important strategic relationships in the 21st century. ""Our two great nations are bound by friendship, by commerce, as partners in the fight against terrorism, and as brother-and-sister in the cause of freedom and our commitment to democracy — and today, I say with confidence – under the leadership of President Donald Trump, our friendship will grow deeper and our partnership will grow stronger — for the
benefit of both our nations, and all our people,"" Pence said.
With Trump taking so many steps to improve the business climate in the US, Pence said the truth is that these actions will give Indian companies record opportunities to invest in America.

""I am confident — that with your help, and with the commitment that President Trump and Prime Minister Modi renewed on Wednesday — we will usher in a new era of jobs, opportunity, and prosperity — for both our countries, and for all our people,"" Pence said.
He also praised several Indian companies for creating tens and thousands of jobs in America. Pence mentioned several Indian companies including Wipro, Infosys and Spicejet.
""Thanks to the companies represented in this room, the trade relationship between the United States and India is flourishing. It's remarkable to think that not even 20 years ago, two-way trade between our nations was less than $20 billion per year. But by the end of last year, it had grown by more than 500 percent to an annual $115 billion,"" he said.
""On the other side of the ledger, Indian businesses I’m glad to report are investing in America at an unprecedented rate. For instance: Earlier this year, Infosys announced it would hire 10,000 new American workers at four US-based technology centers, one of which will be in my home state of Indiana. And we thank you for investing and believing in America,"" Pence said.
""Our heartfelt appreciation to all the businesses represented here for your investment in our nation's future.  Yet the truth is the United States and India we believe have only scratched the surface when it comes to bilateral investment and trade,"" he said.
""On Tuesday, President Trump and Prime Minister Modi committed to expanding and balancing our trade relationship in the years ahead,"" the vice president said. India is projected to become the world's third-largest market for planes and passengers, he noted.
""American companies are already providing airport infrastructure and the airplanes themselves. I just had the chance to meet with the CEO of SpiceJet who just last week placed an order for 40 brand new Boeing jets, on top of 100 new jets it ordered earlier this year,"" he said.
""I know that American companies are going to continue to give India's aviation industry the wings it needs to soar.  And let me just take the opportunity, as the President did on Tuesday, to say thank you to SpiceJet for investing and believing in American workers and American businesses,"" Pence said.
Energy, he said, was another area for a more robust partnership. ""India boasts the world's fastest-growing economy. But it can't continue without energy, and American producers and grid developers are the best-suited to provide it. From liquefied natural gas, to nuclear power, to clean coal, to everything in between, American energy and American expertise can help power India's future,"" he said."
First Post,India,,"Narendra Modi met Donald Trump: And together, they issued a highly unambitious statement"," Narendra Modi's first meeting with Donald Trump — at least the section of it that was put out in the public domain —  was underwhelming. A look back at the first joint statement issued by this duo's predecessors (Manmohan Singh and Barack Obama respectively) supports that assessment, but we'll get back to that shortly.
Given the sheer weight of expectation piled onto Modi's US visit (in no small part by a few of our own news outlets), the resultant joint statement was always going to buckle at the knees. And so, it was always going to be unfair to expect some sort of detailed and expansive joint statement that covered every aspect of the India-US relationship, to emanate from this meeting.
Plus, it's worth bearing in mind that this was the first meeting between Modi and Trump, in the latter's capacity as President of the United States. So just what did the statement contain?
Terrorism was expected to feature in the joint statement and to an extent it did:
- Naming Laskhar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammad and the D-Company? Check, but those names had popped up in past Modi-Obama joint statements too.
- Calling for information-exchange and an expansion of intelligence-sharing and operational-level counterterrorism cooperation? Check, but we've heard this before.
- Affirming support for the UN Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism proposed by India? Check, but there's nothing new here either.
- Pledging to work together to prevent proliferation of weapons of mass destruction? Check, but same as above.
- Welcoming a new consultation mechanism on domestic and international terrorist designations listing proposals? This is new and a welcome move, particularly since the US took 25 years to take cognisance of Syed Salahuddin as a global terrorist.
What of Pakistan, you may well ask:
The leaders called on Pakistan to ensure that its territory is not used to launch terrorist attacks on other countries. They further called on Pakistan to expeditiously bring to justice the perpetrators of the 26/11 Mumbai, Pathankot, and other cross-border terrorist attacks perpetrated by Pakistan-based groups.
Inadequate. That's really the most adequate word to describe this jejune and dare-I-say-it, perfunctory mention of India's neighbour. 'Calling on Pakistan' to do something has historically not proven to be an effective exercise and the two sentences above fall dramatically short of identifying Pakistan's own role in grooming, sheltering and harbouring those 'Pakistan-based groups'.
There was also much speculation about how Modi and Trump would address the issue of China and they did so at length in the first sub-section of the joint statement. That particular sub-section is reproduced and annotated below:
Democratic Stalwarts in the Indo-Pacific Region (the title of the section alone appears to be a thinly-veiled jibe) 
As responsible stewards (as opposed, presumably, to China)  in the Indo-Pacific region, President Trump and Prime Minister Modi agreed that a close partnership between the United States and India is central to peace and stability in the region. Recognising the significant progress achieved in these endeavours, the leaders agreed to take further measures to strengthen their partnership. In accordance with the tenets outlined in the UN Charter, they committed to a set of common principles for the region, according to which sovereignty and international law are respected and every country can prosper (Beijing's run-ins with International Law with regard to the South China Sea have been widely documented) . To this end, the leaders:
reiterate the importance of respecting freedom of navigation, overflight, and commerce throughout the region (South China Sea reference);
call upon all nations to resolve territorial and maritime disputes peacefully and in accordance with international law (A number of Southeast Asian States would concur);
support bolstering regional economic connectivity through the transparent development of infrastructure and the use of responsible debt financing practices, while ensuring respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, the rule of law (a reference to the One Belt One Road initiative...), and the environment; and
call on other nations in the region to adhere to these principles (...and the countries that support it).
Aside from this, there was a mention of Afghanistan and the work both nations are doing in the country, a few lines about growing strategic convergence, a section on free trade and the customary sign-off that Trump would reciprocate Modi's visit at some point in the future. All of which were generalities, devoid of substance.
What in the name of Pyongyang?
The biggest surprise found itself on Trump's own remarks to the press as well as the joint statement and resulted in a fair bit of head-scratching. As he neared the end of his remarks, Trump said, ""I also thank the Indian people... for joining us in applying new sanctions against the North Korean regime. The North Korean regime is causing tremendous problems and is something that has to be dealt with, and probably dealt with rapidly."" Wait, what?
The joint statement read, ""The leaders strongly condemned continued provocations by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), emphasising that its destabilising pursuit of nuclear and ballistic missile programs poses a grave threat to regional security and global peace. The leaders called on DPRK to strictly abide by its international obligations and commitments. The leaders pledged to work together to counter the DPRK’s weapons of mass destruction programs, including by holding accountable all parties that support these programs."" Same sentiment, only louder.

According to the Ministry of External Affairs, ""Relations between India and the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea have been generally characterised by friendship, cooperation and understanding."" Pyongyang has never made any threatening overtures to New Delhi, and as per the MEA briefing, North Korea ""has expressed keen interest in importing consumer goods from India every year on ‘deferred payment basis’... They also welcomed participation of Indian companies, Chambers of Commerce, business houses, etc. in their annual trade fairs and various other events for promoting Indian products in the (North Korean) market. They also welcome participation of Indian companies in joint ventures and FDI especially on tourism and hospitality sectors.""
It's more than likely that introducing the topic of North Korea — whether because it seems to be among his biggest agendas or to counter China, or both — into the conversation must have been Trump's idea. That Modi failed to counter that by having a sterner mention of Pakistan introduced is mildly disappointing. Let's move on.

How the first Modi-Trump statement holds up to the first Manmohan-Obama one

It's here that a comparison between the first joint statement issued by Manmohan-Obama and the Modi-Trump one must be drawn. And there's no better place to start than the title of the statements. The Manmohan-Obama one was titled Partnership for a Better World, while the Modi-Trump one was titled Prosperity through Partnership.
A lot can be read into those titles, but it's more instructive to delve deeper. The Manmohan-Obama statement included the line stating that ""the India-US partnership is indispensable for global peace and security"", while Monday night's statement spoke of how ""the United States and India — leading engines of growth in the global economy — should intensify their economic cooperation to make their nations stronger and their citizens more prosperous"" (emphasis added).
Where one set of leaders sought to seek solutions for the world at large with an ambitious mission statement, the other set appears to have set its sights on the vikaas of their respective nations above all else. Neither approach is right or wrong. They are just different approaches. But these differing approaches are what India gets when dealing with a world leader of the regular sort on one hand, and a world leader of social media on the other.
The Manmohan-Obama statement addressed security and terrorism, sustainable global development, clean energy, global economic revival (in light of the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-08), education and empowerment, healthcare and global cooperation. The Modi-Trump one focused on the Asia-Pacific region (see above), terrorism, security, India-US strategic convergence, free and fair bilateral trade, and a section on digital threats.

It can be argued that the Global Financial Crisis isn't a thing any more and that cyber threats were less grave back in 2009, but the tone and approach of both statements are unarguably polar opposites. While one choose to look at all the possibilities for a brighter future for all, the other chooses to look at the basic minimum to ensure a brighter future for both countries. A lack of ambition has never been something one can accuse Modi of having, but the statement on which he signed off, unfortunately suffers from just that.
Worst of all for the Prime Minister of India — a man who spoke around 18 months ago at the COP21 Summit in Paris of the need to move away from fossil fuels, and was in many ways a champion of the climate agreement that emerged from the summit — is the following section in the joint statement:
The leaders called for a rational approach that balances environment and climate policy, global economic development, and energy security needs.
President Trump affirmed that the United States continues to remove barriers to energy development and investment in the United States and to US energy exports so that more natural gas, clean coal, and renewable resources and technologies are available to fuel India’s economic growth and inclusive development.
A 'rational approach'? Knowing how Trump feels about the Paris Agreement, it stands to reason that a rational approach is not said agreement. Next, the statement speaks of India importing more coal. The less said about that, the better. That clean energy doesn't even feature on the joint statement is one thing. That Modi signed off on a document that casts aside the sort of ambition and hope he instilled in world leaders in Paris in December 2015 is something completely different.
Perhaps, Modi found himself curtailed by a lack of leverage when it came to inserting points into the statement. The mention of North Korea is a case in point. Maybe the discussions didn't go off as well as we were all led to believe. It's likely we'll never know.
But, as we do know, actual foreign policy doesn't hew all that closely to joint statements and it's best not to dwell too long on it. Things will pan out as they will."
First Post,India,Washington,"US will need India to counter China's growing influence in the world, says American think-tank","Even as the Trump administration is cosying up to the Chinese, the US will need India to counter Beijing's growing influence in the world, a top American think-tank has said.
Describing India as a ""key piece in the jigsaw"" for the US, the Atlantic Council urged the Trump administration to prioritise its ties with New Delhi. 
""Given the advancements that China has made both economically and militarily, the US will need to channel considerable resources to assert its global and regional primacy,"" Atlantic Council, a top American think-tank said in a policy paper 'Transforming India from a Balancing to Leading Power' released ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit. ""To accomplish this, India remains a key piece in the jigsaw for the US. President (Donald) Trump will need to assure India that it is not merely a regional prop to balance Beijing's power in the region, but a top priority for US foreign policy under the Trump administration,"" said the policy paper authored jointly by the former Union Minister Manish Tewari and Bharat Gopalaswamy, director of the South Asia Center of the Atlantic Council.

""While Trump has favoured rapprochement with Beijing so far, there will need to be more initiative and effort from Washington to ensure that India-US relations continue to strengthen. The Asia-Pacific Stability Initiative proposed by Senator John McCain could be one effective way to signal the United States' intent towards India,"" it said.
The proposed USD 7.5 billion funding, if approved, could be a starting point for further India-US engagement in the years to come, they wrote. Noting that during his campaign, Trump indicated that strengthening US-India ties would be a top priority for his administration, the two authors said Trump went on to woo India by openly vilifying China on a host of issues not limited to the South China Sea.

""However, since he was sworn into office, Trump has displayed an unprecedented degree of warmth in his attitude towards China, leaving Indian observers puzzled,"" it said.
""In his first few months in office, President Trump has demonstrated that Asia continues to be a major focus of US foreign policy,"" the policy paper said.
""His administration has addressed a multitude of issues related to China and the Korean Peninsula in a short time frame, reiterating US interests in the region. That being said, a more pressing concern is whether President Trump will work to enhance the stature of the Indo-American relationship in the same vein as his predecessors,"" Tewari and Gopalaswamy said
"
First Post,India,,Narendra Modi's US visit: Having low expectations from Donald Trump may not be a bad thing for India,"This will mark the prime minister's first meeting with the newly elected US president Donald Trump and the dynamics of this engagement may far outstrip the strategic importance of India-US relationship. That is not to say that India should or should not look forward to a positive outcome but to imply that Modi and Trump's first face-to-face interaction may set the tone for future engagements.
This is a tad unusual. Meetings between heads of state take place within immaculately laid paradigms governed by strict protocols of officialdom, where even shaking hands or turning to the camera is carefully rehearsed. This is done to take unpredictability away from diplomatic pow-wows and to control, to the extent possible, the outcomes.

This theory is useless when it comes to Trump because he is the very epitome of unpredictability. During the Cold War, US reporters in Kremlin beat would have given an arm and a leg to get even a shadow of an idea of what the Russian leaders were up to. The current US president tweets his strategies and musings while watching television, sometimes keeping even his staff members and spokespersons in the dark. During the recent NATO summit in Brussels, Trump deviated from his speech and omitted a key line pledging support to US allies in the event of an attack, leaving European leaders and even his own delegation aghast. During the campaign for US presidential election, author and documentary filmmaker Michael Moore had described Trump as a ""human Molotov cocktail"" whom his angry supporters may lob inside the Oval Office just to take revenge on the 'broken' system. Moore's contention, that Trump's ideologies ""do not fall under capitalism, socialism or even democracy"" turned out to be prescient. ""His ideology is called Donald J Trump. He believes in Donald J Trump. If it's good for him, then it's a good thing. Not good for him, it's a bad thing.""
It is impossible, therefore, for India to settle on an agenda when Modi eventually meets the mercurial leader. The prime minister may be required to improvise — like French president Emmanuel Macron did while shaking Trump's hands to not let himself be bullied — to grab opportunities or control fallouts. Media reports indicate that the visit may be a Spartan affair, and Modi may not go beyond a one-on-one with Trump and some engagements with top CEOs. There might not be any glitzy events with the Indian Diaspora.
The Times of India's Chidanand Rajghatta writes from Washington that ""New Delhi is quite happy to sacrifice the thrills and frills, as long as there are no spills,"" and adds that ""vacancies in the administration's US State Department or Foreign Affairs set-up (and the administration's inability to fill them quickly) has made life difficult for foreign diplomatic setting up visits for leaders from their home countries.""
The bar of expectations is being set very low, and that is not necessarily a bad thing. Trump is forcing nearly everyone — allies, strategic partners and even foes — to hit the reset button in the bilateral relationship and in some cases, swap sides, as Qatar found out to its surprise. The Indian effort might be restricted to controlling the controllable and reducing the unknowable. The key, as foreign secretary S Jaishankar had eloquently put it recently, is not to ""demonise"" Trump but to ""analyse"" him.

New Delhi must be prepared to accept that India is not among the focus areas for a Trump administration that is beset by domestic and international worries. On the domestic front, less than six months into his stint, Trump is already running the risk of exposing himself to impeachment proceedings. As an AFP report points out, if deposed FBI director James Comey testifies before the Senate that Trump tried to derail a counter-espionage probe, it might pave the way for allegations of the president obstructing justice and the door for impeachment might be made ajar.
The numbers are still heavily loaded in Trump's favour but it is evident that the US president will have more pressing concerns in his mind than Modi's visit right now. On the international front, a combination of his own immaturity, North Korea's belligerence and China's hard-boiled realism has resulted in a previously antagonistic Trump eating off Xi Jinping's hands, significantly increasing India's unease.

The recent headlines around Trump's assertion that India tried to sponge ""billions and billions of dollars"" off the US to join the Paris Climate Agreement and India's forceful rejection of the charge do not make for a happy ambience. There is also the deepening uncertainty over H1B visa programme where the Trump administration and Modi government are on opposite poles. It would seem that decades of careful investment in a mutually beneficial bilateral, strategic tie is going to be undone under Trump.
However, the theory of unpredictability states that we cannot even take a negative outcome for granted. India enjoys bipartisan support in the US Congress and the Indian-American community has grown in influence and is beginning to sway US policy decisions. There are also structural insurances in place in military-strategic affairs. The Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) under which both militaries will use each other's bases for repair and restocking of supplies, the co-development and co-production of military technologies under the Defense Technology and Trade Initiative (DTTI) are all in place. The arms trade is also a strong adhesive.
Keeping these in mind, and be shorn of the hype, Modi might get exactly the opportunity that he needs to set the course of a very transactional India-US relationship under Trump that is based not just on common strategic imperatives but on quid pro quo. And, we might need to show some ""strategic patience"" with Trump. For instance, both leaders have a very specific agenda in reviving manufacturing jobs. Instead of hampering ties, 'Make America Great Again' and 'Make In India' may be complementary initiatives to fit both nations' interest.
There will also be strategic convergence on terrorism. Trump has taken a strident line on terrorism and has often been politically incorrect on this subject. Modi may find a willing listener in the US president on cross-border terrorism, India's pet peeve.
The crux for India will be to go into negotiations with an open mind, expecting the unexpected."
First Post,India,,"Narendra Modi's US visit: All eyes on India's crucial trip to pacify Donald Trump, play role of middle power","Narendra Modi wrapped up his four-nation tour with the commitment to go beyond the Paris Agreement on climate change. The swing through Germany, Spain, Russia and France has given the prime minister the kind of coverage in the world press that such bilateral visits seldom gets. It has been one of his most successful visits to Europe, one which seems to have not only repaired ties with old ally Russia but also taken ahead India's relationship with the other three European powers. A multi-polar world seems to be emerging, and in this, India can play an important role. It would be interesting to see how Modi’s visit to the US, which is scheduled to take place at the end of the month will pan out. Modi will meet US president Donald Trump for the first time during this meeting.


Much of this has to do with the uncertainty that Trump has brought to the world stage. China has been a major player in the international arena for some time, but with the US turning inwards — protectionist and isolationist — India is in a position to play a rightful role as a middle power. Ever since Trump decided to walk out of the Paris Agreement, which the world community had agreed on, climate change has been at the heart of the global debate. And Modi’s assurance has been music to Europe. ""The Paris climate agreement is a shared legacy of the world. It will benefit the future generations as well,"" Modi said addressing a joint news conference with French president Emmanuel Macron. ""We have natural resources because our previous generations protected those resources. We must do the same for our future generations,"" Modi said. The India-led solar alliance is gaining traction and the brand new French president will travel to India by the end of the year to endorse it. European leaders and Canada’s Justin Trudeau are moving closer.
India, which under Narendra Modi had appeared to be moving at a breathless speed to the US camp, is now going to recalibrate his move to make sure its options are not limited. There was much hope in India when the Hindu Republican Coalition with links to the BJP and the larger Sangh Parivar staunchly supported Trump during the elections, even making him mouth Modi's slogan at an event where the US president had made a brief appearance as a presidential candidate. Pujas were held in India too to pray for a Trump victory. Trump’s diatribe against China, as a candidate also gave the impression that like George W Bush and his Republican administration, Washington would use India to balance China’s rise, especially in the Asia-Pacific region. Before the elections, Trump accused Beijing of currency manipulation, called climate change a myth propagated by the Chinese and gave all indications that the US would break away from Barack Obama’s policy towards China.

Yet, after a meeting with President Xi Jinping, Trump changed his views. Trump's grandchildren even sang Chinese songs for the visiting Chinese president and his wife. The US president has been praising China for its support to contain the North Korea. The signs are that the US-China relations, initiated by former US president Richard Nixon and pursued by all succeeding American presidents, now appears to be followed by Trump.
Apart from the changed stance on China, Trump has not made it easy for India. Besides the H1B visa issues for India’s IT sector, Trump’s contention that India and China were demanding billions of dollars for implementing the climate deal has nothing to do with facts. It has to do with the US president’s support base and the alternative reality he prefers. The truth is that the industrialised world, especially the US, has contributed to climate change by being the principle pollutants. Emerging economies like India and China are only now becoming pollutants. So, the major part of the blame has to rightfully go to the US and other developed nations. But Trump loves to twist facts to suit himself. Even today, the US remains the number two polluter in the world. China is first and India third. Yet China and India are trying to clean up their acts. China, of course, is far ahead as it has much more resources at its command. But India too is trying to do its best.

A peeved Europe is now turning to both India and China. Both countries are embracing the invitation from the EU with open arms. India will be working with Germany, France, Spain and others in the EU for clean technology. But it will be difficult for the world to find a replacement for the US with its vast resource. Though tempers are frayed at both sides of the Atlantic, for now, this cannot be permanent. The gap between the US and the EU will have to be bridged at some time, the earlier the better for the world. The US after all, despite its relative decline, still remains the leader of the free world. It cannot be ignored because it is well ahead in terms of technology, defence, space and every other field.
Modi is well aware of this. So, much will depend on how Modi’s American visit shapes up. But New Delhi is making sure that in these uncertain times, the best policy is to have as many friends as possible so that India’s interests do not suffer. For now, a country like India, with its young population and ready markets as well as a commitment to free trade, the environment and democracy is making a mark in Europe. Modi’s visit could not have been at a better time."
First Post,India,,Donald Trump's first 100 days: What does his presidency mean for India?,"One hundred days on, ever since 'US President Donald Trump' became reality, are we any closer to an answer? That, in my opinion, depends on how seriously we take Trump's words.
On the one hand, there are some incoherent, distracted, and thoroughly random string of words dropped by the President of United States about India ever since the run-up to the elections. Then, we have the things he has actually done, or at least shown some inclination to do, in the first 100 days of his presidency. But what Trump says and what he does are fortunately or unfortunately untethered from each other. Nevertheless, his near-contrasting speeches, off-hand inconsistent references to India, and the absolute scrutiny of his policies under a persistent media glare have at least given us some fodder for discussion.
Here are some of the key things that actually made/ will make an impact on India.

Donald Trump. AP
H1-B Visa policy
No discussion on the Trump impact on India can begin without mentioning his much touted rejig of the H1-B policy.
""I will be the greatest jobs producer God ever created,"" he once famously said  (yes, really!): ""You can’t allow policies that allows China, Mexico, Japan, Vietnam, India. You can’t allow policies that allows business to be ripped out of the United States like candy from a baby.”
Trump and the men driving his administration have mostly been against the H1-B visa, immigrants and 'outsiders' all their lives. According to a  report in The Wire, Trump, in his 2011 book Time To Get Tough, advocated a 15 percent tax on companies for outsourcing jobs to places like India, and a 20 percent tax for importing goods and services.
It was only after assuming the presidency that he took detours, went back on his words several times and amended the visa laws consecutively, which led to chaos and confusion.
Finally, an executive order was signed only last week that tightened the screw on employers ""who have a high ratio of H-1B workers as compared to US workers, as defined by statute"". It will apparently help US companies recruit ""highly-skilled foreign nationals,""only when there is a ""shortage of qualified workers in the country."" The move has stunned the IT sector in the US, one of the largest industries to employ Indian workers on the H1-B Visa. This comes at a time when Indian IT industry was already feeling the pinch of increased US protectionism as the previous regime had also passed some laws, including increasing the visa fee substantially, according to a report in The Hindu.
The extent of the impact can be gauged from the fact that each year over 65,000 workers and another 20,000 graduate student are admitted through the H1-B visa programme. The order has sent ripples within the Indian workers in US, who feel their future could be in limbo after Trump raised the bar for short-term Visa for skilled workers.
The seriousness of the issue is further highlighted by the fact that Prime Minister Narendra Modi implored Washington to have a ""balanced and farsighted perspective"" on the issue. A statement released by the PMO said, ""The prime minister referred to the role of skilled Indian talent in enriching the American economy and society, and urged developing a reflective, balanced and farsighted perspective on movement of skilled professionals.""
U-turn on ""world champions"" of currency manipulation
Trump's tough stance against China had been one of the few bright spots for India under his presidency. Trump's vows to curtail increasingly aggressive economic policies of Chinese were, to say the least, not disadvantageous for India. His assertion that the US is not necessarily bound by the “One China policy,”was the cherry on top.
However, much has changed since then. Trump has clearly softened his stance towards China, who he needs by his side in the event of a ""major major conflict with North Korea."" Trump even lavished praise on Chinese President Xi Jinping for trying to rein in North Korea.
For now, it looks like India, who was hoping for a more muscular approach from Trump, will have to live with the fact that political constraints require the US president to at least have a working relationship with China.
Pakistan: 'The most dangerous country in world'

Here is some good news for India: The Trump administration has finally taken a line against India's arch rival that New Delhi would wholeheartedly approve. In one of his campaign speeches, Trump branded Pakistan the ""most dangerous country in the world today"" adding that he thinks that the only country that can keep Islamabad in check is India.
Recently he said that Pakistan will have to be ""less selective than it has been in past"" in its dealing with terrorists.

However, India must exercise restraint on overtly relying on Trump's words for two reasons. First, he is known to flip-flop on his own statements and there certainly is no action to back those words so far. Secondly, India may do well to remember that Trump's predecessor Barack Obama's bonhomie with Modi did not stop him from selling more fighter jets to Pakistan. Islamabad is too vital to Washington's interests in Afghanistan and Middle East for it to ever openly and tangibly support India's narrative on Pakistan.
Increase of racial crimes against Indians
With recent shocking incidents of racial attacks on Indians in US, it is largely perceived that such attacks are on a rise under Trump. Shortly after Trump was elected as president, a man of Indian origin was abused and assaulted in Pennsylvania. ""I don't want you sitting next to me...you people... things are different now,"" the man who assaulted the Indian-American was quoted as saying, according to a report by NDTV. 
The murderous assault on Srinivas Kuchibhotla is still be fresh on people's minds. Kuchibotla, an Indian engineer, was killed and two others were injured, when an American man opened fire on them after allegedly yelling ""get out of my country."" Other similar reports have dotted newspapers in India, every now and then.
One can argue that the increased media glare because of some of Trump's unpalatable comments on Muslims and immigrants has given these crimes more prominence. However, many believe that it was the Trump rhetoric that has mainstreamed and even legitimised the insecurities and racial hatred of some.
The White House has officially condemned the attack on Kuchibhotla, but much more needs to be done to prevent Asian minorities being under the threat of racial attacks.
Trump calls Modi a ""great man"": A look at formal interactions between India, US
Some progress has been made on this front within Trump's 100 days in office, despite some of his policies appearing to be adversarial for India.
Trump, in a rare move, called Modi to congratulate him on his party's win in the Assembly elections. It is not customary for US presidents to call and congratulate world leaders on their success in local elections.
Earlier too, he has heaped praise on the Indian Prime Minister, signalling he would like to pick up from where Obama left as far as Indo-US ties are concerned.
“I look forward to working with Prime Minister Narendra Modi who has been very energetic in reforming India’s bureaucracy. Great man. I applaud him,"" Trump had said.
Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley also visited US, a first by a minister of Modi's cabinet after Trump's election, where he flagged India's concerns on the H1-B visa issue to the Trump administration.
Several high-level diplomatic engagements have also kept the ball rolling as far as India-US interactions are concerned. Only recently, India's foreign secretary, S Jaishankar has been in talks with US diplomats, laying the ground for Modi's visit to the White House later this year. The defense advisers of the two nations have also been in touch, signalling that increased defence coordination with India is on the cards.
Trump a ""fan of Hindus and Indians""?
Trump had famously lauded India during his campaign in these words: ""I am a big fan of Hindu. I am a big fan of India... If I’m elected President, the Indian and Hindu community will have a true friend in the White House. That I can guarantee you.”
Whether his words tether to the realities of India-US relationships remains to be seen. After all, 100 days is too small a period in which to gauge in which way the winds are blowing. And Trump's foreign policy has been a series of confused statements and contrasting actions. To begin with, the President of the United States must learn the fact that 'India' is not synonymous with 'Hindus'. A complex country with a diverse and heterogeneous society like India would, at best be a cautious ally, given Trump's temperamental approach to foreign policy.
The most optimistic guess would be that Trump views India favourably, if not as a true ally. But that will not stop him from keeping a balance sheet approach towards New Delhi. He rose to power on the promises of job creation and economic overhaul. Those policy decisions are going to stay dear to him and any possible conflict of interest with India, in that light, is unavoidable."
First Post,India,Washington,India-US defence relationship is on right path: Ashton Carter,"India-US defence relationship is on the right path and the two nations are discussing ways to develop this partnership through technology sharing, co-production, America's outgoing Defence Secretary Ashton Carter said on Wednesday.

""We're on the right path. It's just a matter of taking those steps. And they involve deepening our cooperation in lots of ways. I mean, there's exercises and other kinds of operational activities,"" Carter told reporters at final Pentagon news conference. In various capacities, Carter has been closely involved in building India-US defence relationship over the years and in the last few years he gave a great impetus to the ties between the two largest democracies of the world. Last summer he was instrumental in US declaring India as a major defence partner.

""There is something that I think Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi and Defence Minister (Manohar) Parrikar have been equally intent upon as President Obama and myself, which is the development of defence relationships for new technology, which involve technology sharing, co-production, and so forth,"" Carter said in response to a question.

""We have a great number of projects. I was in New Delhi not long ago and discussing all these, and there are many of them -- so too many to enumerate. All of them on course. They all have their own schedules and sort of technical timelines to them,"" he said.

""But this is a relationship which is, I've said many times, is destined for the future because of the nature of our two societies, the values that we share; the human relationship between our peoples,"" Carter said.

First Post,India,,"India-US defence partnership: Industries, not governments, can make it a success","In a recently-held national seminar (14 December) on the status of defence industry in the country, which was attended by Home Minister Rajnath Singh and Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar, some panelists did point out, cursorily though, the significance of India being granted the unique status by the United States as its 'Major Defence Partner' (MDP). The partnership, if pursued both in letter and spirit, will boost Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s 'Make in India” programme in the defence sector so that India could not only become self-reliant in arms but also emerge as a major exporter of arms. However there remains the question of big “if”, upon which this analysis focuses.
The MDP status to India needs to be seen against the backdrop of the development of the US military industrial complex (MIC). Incidentally, the term “military-industrial-complex” was coined in the US by then president Dwight Eisenhower during the Cold War to welcome the emergence of what is said “the second era” of the American MIC. During the first era, which lasted from 1787 to 1941, the defence sector in the United States consisted totally of the government-owned arsenals and shipyards. However, with the US participating in the Second World War, Franklin Roosevelt established the “War Production Board” by conscripting the major private industries, particularly those in the automobile sector, into wartime service. But after the war ended, not only did these private companies, such as Boeing and General Motors stay and consolidate their involvement in the military sector, they were also joined by others like AT&T, General Electric and IBM.
One of the important features of this second era was that the Pentagon financed the private sector, which, in turn, created world class technologies that were for use by not only the military but also by ordinary citizens. One can cite in this regard the examples of drone, night vision goggles, GPS in cars, and most important, the internet. The end of the Cold War in the 1990s saw the emergence of the “third era” (and this prevails at the moment), whose important features are as follows.
First, the industry shifted from diversified conglomerates and was managed by defence-only firms.
Secondly, the contribution of the Pentagon, both financially and technologically, has been declining, thanks to the shrinking defence budgets. As a result, and this is the third feature, the American MICs are increasingly buying commercial technologies (either buying or giving these technology providers shares) such as cloud computing, cyber security, nanotechnology and even smart phones. Just see how Google acquired Boston Dynamics that had created BigDog, a four-legged robot that can support soldiers in rough terrain.
However, these features are increasingly proving insufficient to sustain the US defence industry. Although it is courting commercial companies, it prefers the American ones. It is not globalising itself properly, shunning the option of co-producing products abroad with allies and friends the way the Japanese and Koreans are developing their technologies and manufacturing brands in foreign countries, from where they are exporting them to various parts of the world. America’s F-35 example, by distributing the burden of the development cost of the fifth generation fighter plane with some Nato allies, is said to be insufficient.
No wonder William J Lynn III, a former US deputy secretary of defence argues for starting a new fourth era in which the Pentagon must take a more active role in recruiting outside companies, “keeping in mind that their futures are inextricably intertwined”. According to him, “The United States has the opportunity to look beyond its borders to turn this fourth era to its advantage. Since the Second World War, the country’s technological advantages have protected its national security. To maintain that advantage, the United States must adapt to — and ultimately embrace — the trends that will come to define its future”.
Can India fit into this scheme of things, particularly when Modi’s much-repeated calls to 'Make in India' continue to remain in the headlines? The US thinks that India can. The MDP status is a logical conclusion of this trend. In essence, it paves the way for India to be treated at par with America’s closest allies — Nato partners and countries with security treaties — such as Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea on defence-related trade and technology transfer.

In fact, the idea of the MDP was agreed upon during the summit meeting between Modi and President Barack Obama in June this year. “Noting that the US-India defense relationship can be an anchor of stability and given the increasingly strengthened cooperation in defense, the United States hereby recognises India as a Major Defence Partner,” the joint statement of the June meeting had stated.
However, this accorded status to India by Obama required the subsequent Congressional approval as per the American laws. 

Although the House of Representatives endorsed the idea, the Senate sought more clarifications. It was not that the Senate was against granting the unique status to India; it was apparently not happy with “the definition of ‘major defence partner’ designation that had been left a little unclear and vague by the administration.” Accordingly, the differences were reconciled and a separate section on 'Enhancing defense and security cooperation with India' (Section 1292) was added in “The National Defense Authorisation Act (NDAA) 2017 (the US military’s budget for next year), which was passed by the House of Representatives first and then in the Senate. The NDAA, likely to be signed by Obama within a week’s time for legal enforcement, ensures the continuity of the MDP status to India under the future governments as well.
Section 1292 of the NDAA asks the secretaries of defence and state to take steps necessary to recognise India as America’s major defence partner of the U.S. and asks the administration “to designate an individual within the executive branch who has experience in defence acquisition and technology to reinforce and ensure, through inter-agency policy coordination, the success of the Framework for the US-India Defence Relationship; and to help resolve remaining issues impeding US-India defence trade, security cooperation, and co-production and co-development opportunities.”
It also calls for “approval and facilitation of transfer of advanced technology, consistent with US conventional arms transfer policy, to support combined military planning with India’s military for missions such as humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, counter-piracy, freedom of navigation, and maritime domain awareness missions, and to promote weapons systems interoperability.” Further, it seeks “collaboration with India to develop mutually agreeable mechanisms to verify the security of defence articles, defence services and related technology such as appropriate cyber security and end use monitoring arrangements consistent with US’ export control laws and policy.” In fact, it asks the secretaries of defence and state to submit within 180 days of the passage of the Act to the Congressional Defence Committees and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives ""a report on how the US is supporting its defence relationship with India"".

It was against this background that US defence secretary Ashton Carter visited India last week to meet Parrikar (their seventh interaction in the past two years). They finalised India’s designation as a 'Major Defence Partner' of the US. As the joint statement issued after their meeting (8 December) said, “The designation as a ‘Major Defence Partner’ is a status unique to India and institutionalises the progress made to facilitate defense trade and technology sharing with India to a level at par with that of the United States’ closest allies and partners, and ensures enduring cooperation into the future.” In concrete terms what it means is that India now can get access to “99 percent of the US defence technologies” as the export hurdle of high-tech US military hardware and technology to India is removed. India will also receive licence-free access to a wide range of dual-use technologies in conjunction with steps that India has committed to take to advance its export control objectives. The US government will inform the review of requests to export defence articles, defence services, or related technology to India under the Arms Export Control Act, and inform any regulatory and policy adjustments that may be appropriate.
American officials say that the MDP status is in support of India’s 'Make in India' initiative towards the development of robust defence industries and their integration into the global supply chain. The United States will facilitate the export of goods and technologies for these industries through joint ventures, meaning thereby that the US is now more than willing to transform its defence cooperation with India from “simply buying and selling” to “co-production, co-development, and freer exchange of technology”.
However, one has to become a little cautious with regard to actual progress of the India-US defence industrial partnership. When one talks of US investment in the Indian defence sector, it should be realised that the ability of the American government to be a source of investment is quite limited. It simply does not have enough investible reserves. Instead, the investible resources are in the US private sector, which, in turn, make their own judgments of where to invest, depending on the recipient country’s infrastructures, legal regime, administrative machinery, and above all broad political consensus on liberalisation of the economy. There is then another limiting factor of the present inabilities of India’s arms industries to absorb the technologies that foreign companies are prepared to transfer. It may be noted in this context that if India and France were not able to fructify the original Rafale MMRCA deal, it was due to as much monetary factor as the lack of absorptive capability for the licensed production of the Rafale.
Unfortunately, the Modi government has a lot to do on all these fronts."
First Post,India,,India-US 'major defence partnership' must address New Delhi’s strategic concerns,"US Ambassador to India Richard Rahul Verma has recently stated that the US-Pakistan relationship is “complex”, while US relations with India are more broad-based.
In saying so, Verma will be acutely aware that the US-Pakistan relationship is already on the trajectory towards becoming far more complex with Pakistan being inexorably subsumed by China, the CIA-ISI relationship notwithstanding. With China gearing up to establish an oceanic front in the Gwadar-Omari-Karachi region, a future US-China Cold War-like situation may be inevitable no matter the pretenses, and how and in what timeframe the transition from lukewarm to cold takes place, which will be resisted by China.
President-elect Donald Trump’s statement that the US may not necessarily be bound with the ‘One China’ policy raised hackles in China with Beijing hitting back that it would help the foes of America. Only time will tell how Trump’s remarks about the ‘One China’ policy are followed through in future. However, in all probability he will act against China’s economic policy of ‘dumping’ goods abroad at the cost of target countries. But if China says it will help America’s foes, it is already doing so through proxies of Pakistan as well as through its own links with the Taliban. What will affect South Asia most is how the Trump administration deals with Pakistan now that Generals Michael T Flynn (former director of US Defence Intelligence Agency) and James Mattis (former commander of US Central Command) will be the next National Security Advisor and Secretary of Defence respectively. This is particularly so given their firm views about countering terrorism. Notwithstanding the joint statement on conclusion of the recent ‘Heart of Asia’ Summit categorically naming Pakistani proxies operating in Afghanistan, this had already been explicitly brought out in the report of the United Nations Mission to Afghanistan (UNAMA) in July 2016. These facts have been ignored by the US in the past despite Pakistani proxies, Haqqani Network in particular, targeting US-Nato forces in Afghanistan
With the US Senate clearing a bill characterising India as a “major defence partner”, India-US relations have taken a leap. The 2017 National Defence Authorisation Act (NDAA) was passed by the US House of Representatives by 375 votes to 34. When Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visited Washington in June this year, President Barack Obama had said he looks at India as a major defence partner of the US. The US Senate has now cleared the decks to put an official seal on it before it goes for signatures to Obama, which should be a mere formality. It is significant to note that after the passage of the bill — within 180 days, the secretary of defence and the secretary of state are required to jointly submit to the Congressional Defence Committee, the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives a report on how the US is supporting its defence relationship with India.
The India-US joint statement issued during the visit of Secretary of State John Kerry to India in August 2016 had noted that robust defence ties were the “bedrock” of bilateral strategic and commercial ties, making reference to the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) and the title of “major defence partner” for India that Obama envisaged. In December 2016, Secretary of Defence Ashton Carter made an official visit to India for the seventh institutionalised interaction with Indian counterpart Manohar Parrikar. The joint statement issued during Carter’s visit finalised India’s designation as a “major defence partner” of the US. This special status is unique to India and institutionalises the progress made to facilitate defence trade and technology sharing with India to a level on par with that of America’s closest allies and partners, ensuring enduring cooperation in future.
The emergence of the Defence Technology and Trade Initiative ( DTTI) as an integral and enduring component of India-US security cooperation is a sign that the relationship has matured to a level of strategic importance. The DTTI will strengthen India’s 'Make in India' initiative and both sides committed to convening all-new DTTI working groups prior to the next DTTI group meeting anticipated for February 2017. India-US defence relations in recent years have been on an escalating trajectory. The signing of the Defence Framework Agreement in 2015 was a major signpost.

This along with other agreements laid the blueprint for collaboration between defence establishments of both nations, enabling deeper cooperation. Joint exchange opportunities, in both personnel and training exercises, have expanded and strengthened our bilateral cooperation. The signing of the LEMOA has facilitated additional opportunities for practical engagement and exchange.
What does 'major defence partner' imply? 

Logically, it should result in greater sharing of defence technologies (state-of-the-art ones), co-production of armaments as part of ‘Make in India’ and dovetailing defence plans with the US approach through coordination in military logistics, and in strategic and satellite communications and sensors. The US is also looking at early signing of the Communication and Information Security Memorandum Agreement (CISMOA) and Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement for Geospatial Cooperation (BECA) joint agreements that would complete the trinity of foundational agreements for bilateral defence ties.

Admiral John Richardson had visited India in February 2016 coinciding with India hosting the spectacular international fleet review, in which the US Navy also participated. The year 2016 also saw the navies of India, US and Japan participating in the MALABAR exercise in the Western Pacific, much to the chagrin of China. The India-US Maritime Dialogue has been ongoing with strategic interests converging with respect to the Indo-Pacific region.
But while the US interests in the bilateral relationship centre mainly on cooperation on the seas and defence industry cooperation, the 'major defence partnership' must also address India’s concerns in South Asia. These include the China-Pakistan nexus exporting terrorism to India and Afghanistan. Pakistan’s newly appointed DG ISI, Naveed Mukhtar, has called for Pakistan to be more aggressive against Indian interests in Afghanistan. Pakistan is in illegal occupation of PoK and China-occupied Shaksgam and Aksai Chin — all Indian Territories. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor together with Chinese naval vessels and submarines at Gwadar have strategic implications both for India and the region including on future operations in the IOR. Similarly, the PLA's lodgment in Gilgit-Baltistan, and deployment of strategic weapon platforms have serious implications.
Now that President Vladimir Putin has indicated he will work with Trump in countering terrorism, attention must be paid to Pakistan as the epicentre of terrorism which is supported and abetted by China. The India-US Defence Partnership must focus on these issues, particularly targeting the epicentre of terrorism, ensuring stability and economic progress of Afghanistan and connectivity within South Asia."
First Post,India,,"Donald Trump may play hardball on Kashmir, but India is no pushover","Much of India’s complacency about US president-elect Donald Trump could disappear with the latest news out of Washington. A confident India believed that Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi would get along like a house on fire, considering both are unconventional politicians. The Republican Hindu coalition supporters had Trump mouth a variation of Modi’s election catchphrase  ""Abki baar, Modi sarkar"". The large Hindutva support base of American-Indians in the US, who opted for the Republican candidate for his perceived antagonism against Muslims and his promise to bar Muslims from entering America, will be shocked by his latest assertions.
A businessman without any experience of public life, Trump is at best, unpredictable. His gushing conversation with Pakistan prime minister Nawaz Sharif is a case in point. Now the vice-president elect, Mike Pence has thrown more uncertainty into the equation by talking of the ""extraordinary deal-making skills"" Trump brings to the Oval Office, which could help him resolve the Kashmir dispute between India and Pakistan. This would be just what the doctor ordered for Pakistan, getting the world’s only superpower ready to play arbitrator.
If there is one thing that the squabbling Indian political parties agree on, it is that India-Pakistan and the Kashmir problem will have to be solved by the two countries. From the very beginning, third party intervention was the proverbial red line for successive Indian governments. Despite Pakistan’s best efforts to get the international community involved, India stood firm on ensuring that no third party could play peacemaker. Will things change with an unpredictable president in charge? Will the growing warmth in India-US ties come under strain during the Trump presidency? With Trump announcing General James Mattis as his new defence secretary in the next administration, are we back to the old days of US-Pakistan bonhomie? A retired general, Mattis is familiar with Afghanistan and Pakistan. Like all senior US military officials, he knows the top Pakistani military brass and the thinking of the generals in Rawalpindi. After all, as Cold War allies, the defence forces of the US and Pakistan have a long history of working together. The US and Pakistani military, together with the CIA and ISI worked jointly at the time the Russian soldiers were in Afghanistan.
The enormous funds and the weapons that the US provided to the various mujahideen groups were routed through Pakistan. Mattis, as head of the US Central Command between 2010 and 2013, had Pakistan and Afghanistan as part of his watch. He understand the Pakistani Army’s obsession with India and fears of India’s expanded footprints in Afghanistan. In the early days of US deployment in Pakistan, the US military in their attempt to get Pakistan’s cooperation was keen to placate the generals by ensuring that India’s role in Afghanistan was minimal.

Later, the love-fest between the US and Pakistan army went sour, but James Mattis continues to have an excellent rapport with the Pakistani army. The Trump cabinet is filled with former generals, which is creating some unease among a section of Americans. Generals are more comfortable with the military and may lead to a better US-Pakistan equation. India need not be concerned over this if the Trump administration can persuade the Pakistani army to act against all terror groups, including the anti-India and anti-Afghan government groups. Will the new administration pamper the Pakistani Army to help in Washington’s long term strategic goal of stabilsing Afghanistan? In short, will the old pro-Pakistan tilt in US policy in the subcontinent resurface with Trump?
That could well be, but India is also no pushover. When President Barack Obama appointed the late diplomat Richard Holbrooke as special envoy in charge of Pakistan-Afghanistan and India, New Delhi made sure that the US diplomat got a short shrift in India and he was confined to Af-Pak region. Despite travelling to Delhi, he was not given much access here.

There is little the US can do to play peacemaker if New Delhi refuses to play ball. Also, Trump, once he takes office, may be very different from Trump the president-elect. As a rule, Republican administrations have been good for India. The India-US civil nuclear agreement was signed and sealed by George W Bush’s Republican Administration. But again, Trump is not the usual Republican. Trump remains an enigma not just to India but to the international community as a whole. No one knows what to expect. He may be whimsical or he may grow into his role and become a mature responsible president.
India will resist all attempts to by the US to play peacemaker between India and Pakistan to resolve Kashmir. It is unlikely that Trump can do much when India rebuffs his offer. Considering the huge Indian market that American companies are eyeing, and the fact that the Indian economy can remain unscathed by demonetisation, the businessman in Trump is unlikely to brush off India. Also his concerns about China would inevitably lead to reliance on India to counter China in the region.
But with Trump one can never be too sure about anything!"
First Post,India,Washington,White House happy with progress in India-US relations during Barack Obama's presidency,"The White House has said India-US relations have gained strength during President Barack Obama's regime, and hoped the momentum would continue during Donald Trump's administration.

""I know that President Obama speaks to his counterparts as heads of state frequently. Prime Minister (of India) Modi is one that he enjoys speaking with. They touch base regularly,"" said White House deputy press secretary Eric Schultz on Friday. ""So it's a good thing for the United States if that relationship continues in some strength.""

Schultz was responding to a question on remarks made by President-elect Donald Trump before the elections in which he called for a strong India-US relationship. ""I don't know who can tell you about the future, but I think we'll leave it to historians to judge the contours of the relationship between the United States and India. Obviously, the president is enormously proud of his record of working closely with Prime Minister Modi,"" he said.

""They've worked together on a number of projects, most recently the Paris agreement, that a lot of the work that went into that, again was a deal brokered between nearly 200 countries, but India was a vital part of that. And that could not have been done without Prime Minister Modi's leadership,"" Schultz said."
First Post,India,New York,US college rush: Indian students on American campuses rocket by 25 percent,"Students from India, China and Saudi Arabia, made a beeline straight for American universities, fuelling a college rush and pushing the number of international students at US colleges and universities by 7.1 percent, to top one million in the 2015-2016 academic year, according to the annual Open Doors report released on Monday by the Institute of International Education, in New York.
The report that tracks the US' place in the global college admissions sweepstakes, arrives amid concerns that president-elect Donald Trump could tamp down some of the enthusiasm that we are seeing in foreign student enrolments. For the most part, anti-Trump protests have rocked US college campuses, but there have been incidents of racism, hostility and hate crimes directed at non-white foreign students.
However, the new Open Doors report does not reflect the post-election political environment vitiating US campus life, but instead underscores 10 straight years of robust growth in foreign student enrollment numbers on US college campuses. China sent the most students of any country to America — nearly 328,547 in the latest school year, up 8.1 percent from the year before while India was second, tailed by Saudi Arabia.
""Higher education continues to be the bedrock of our people-to-people ties. More students from India studied in the United States than ever before — at all levels — and I am especially pleased to see the record back-to-back, year-on-year growth in student numbers,"" said US Ambassador Richard Verma in statement.
""The total number of Indian students on US campuses grew by 24.9 percent to 165,918 in 2015-16 from 132,888 in 2014-15,"" according to the Open Doors survey.
The Indian student expansion to 165,918 comes on the back of a 29.4 percent growth spurt the year before, and a 6.1 percent growth rate in 2014 after a three-year decline. Indian students in the US had dropped to 96,754 in the 2012-2013 academic year due to the draw of other education markets like Canada, Britain, Australia, and Europe. However, the Open Doors findings — funded by the US Department of State — show that American universities are in robust health, exerting great pulling power on foreign students who pay full tuition unlike in-state students from the US.

According to the US Department of Commerce, international students poured $30 billion into the US economy in 2014. It's de rigueur for US admissions officers to launch recruiting drives aimed at foreign students who inevitably pay the full sticker price to go to college in the US. Typically, foreign and out-of-state students wind up paying an extra $25,000 to $30,000 a year. This helps smaller US colleges cork the budget gaps caused by reductions in state funding. Of course, Harvard, Princeton, Stanford and other Ivy League colleges are superbly wealthy, boasting multi-billion dollar endowments, so they are only concerned with finding the best brains in the world.
Indian students regard a US degree as a badge of honor, but for many Indian parents, who partly or wholly fund the exercise, expense is the operative word. The weak Indian rupee makes it difficult for some Indian students to pursue their dreams. The average American college tuition and fees of $48,870 for upperclassmen is expensive for most middle class Indian families.

The good news is that more Americans are studying abroad and choosing India as their destination. The Open Door report ranked India 13th among 25 countries that drew American students.
""With efforts such as our Passport to India initiative, we are also seeing the number of American students in India beginning to grow,"" added Verma.
The appeal of a US education is also firmly rooted in job opportunities and internships. In May this year, the US government issued a rule expanding the period for which students in the STEM fields (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) can work on Optional Practical Training (OPT) after graduation, from 29 to 36 months.
""The OPT extension gives us unparalleled opportunities to work in the United States. I have a great internship with Cargill Bioengineering. This will help me to pick up the tab for a lot of my education costs,"" said Rajesh Singhal, who is studying at the Nancy E and Peter C Meinig School of Biomedical Engineering, in Cornell University, at Ithaca.
In keeping with established trends, the report ranked STEM fields, physical or life sciences, health professions, engineering, math and computer science, agriculture, business and management, and social studies as the most popular courses with international students."
First Post,India,New York,"Donald Trump will build greater relations with India, says USINPAC","US President-elect Donald Trump should begin work to kick-starting the economy, enforcing immigration laws and tackling terrorism in Asia, a US-India political action committee has said, as it expressed confidence that the US will have ""greater relations"" with India under his presidency.
The US-India Political Action Committee (USINPAC) congratulated Trump on winning the 2016 Presidential race and commended efforts of all Indian-American supporters who canvassed and fund raised for this successful campaign.

USINPAC Indiana Chair and Chair for Asians for Trump-Pence Campaign Raju Chinthala described Trump's election win as ""historical"" in American history, saying ""he has changed a major political system in the US. He will be a great president and will build greater relations with India."" Assuring the support of Indian-Americans to a Trump administration, USINPAC Chairman Sanjay Puri said Trump ""must work on kick-starting the economy, tackling ISIS and terrorism in Asia. The Indian-American community congratulates President Trump on such a decisive win and pledges to work with the new administration.""
RNC National Committee woman from California Harmeet Kaur Dhillon said Trump’s ""stunning"" victory ""heralds a new era of opportunity and promise"" for all Americans, which will
naturally benefit Indian-Americans.

With Trump's penchant for hiring the best talent, Dhillon expressed confidence that many prominent Indian-Americans will be inducted into the new administration.
""As a diverse community, Indian-Americans can expect the new President to focus on lowering regulatory burdens, reducing taxes on individuals and corporations, focusing on jobs and growth for America before other countries, enforce the laws of the United States, including its immigration laws, and keep our nation safe from harm,"" Dhillon said.

Dhillon added that the country’s leaders have failed to put the nation first, enabling foreign nations to perceive America as weak.
The committee said foreign policy challenges for Trump will include eliminating ISIS, renegotiating the Nato treaty, reconfiguring US relations with Russia and the war in Syria
and illegal immigration.
""President Trump now has the mandate to navigate the party to the future with a mix of conservatism and populism,"" it said.
The political action committee focuses on the over 3.2 million Indian-Americans and works on issues that concern the community. It supports candidates for local, state and federal office and encourages political participation by the Indian- American community."
First Post,India,,"Behind Modi-Obama bonhomie, is a very transactional India-US relationship","When US president Barack Obama exits the White House in January, he will leave behind a foreign policy landscape that has more craters in it than a road in Mumbai after a particularly powerful monsoon season. There will be global challenges that will keep his successor up all night, instead of just dreading the 3 am phone call. But as Obama cedes the Oval Office, there will also be the legacy of a relationship with India that is on a high, building upon the foundation created by his predecessor George W Bush.
When US secretary of state John Kerry participates in the India-US Strategic Dialogue in New Delhi, quite certainly that elevated partnership will be stressed upon. But New Delhi will surely have concerns about the next occupant of the White House.
The Republican nominee Donald Trump has unsettled many in India, as he has done worldwide. We know he really has no policy except one of America First. The Republican National Convention platform in Cleveland was glowing: “India is our geopolitical ally and a strategic trading partner.” But there was some hectoring, as well: “For all of India’s religious communities, we urge protection against violence and discrimination.” On Pakistan, the outlook, notwithstanding some statements that have warmed hawks to the Trump bandwagon, is hardly revolutionary: “Our working relationship is a necessary, though sometimes difficult, benefit to both, and we look toward the strengthening of historic ties that have frayed under the weight of international conflict.” Basically, the same old, same old.
The Democrats manifested a similar tendency: “We will help Pakistan stabilise its polity and build an effective relationship with the predominantly young population of this strategically located, nuclear-armed country.” And their platform on India also gushed about continuing to “to invest in a long-term strategic partnership with India — the world’s largest democracy, a nation of great diversity, and an important Pacific power.”

Both parties rattled their sabres at China, spoke of defeating the Islamic State and took potshots at the Russians.
While Trump offers the X-factor, Hillary Clinton is a known quantity, and while considered pro-India, has a track record at Foggy Bottom, the State Department’s headquarters, that’s not very encouraging. She played a part in denying India a role as the Obama administration drafted its original Af-Pak policy, and also supervised the $7.5 billion handout to Pakistan that resulted from an Act fostered by her successor, Kerry.

When Obama assumed office, the first state dinner he hosted was for then prime minister Manmohan Singh. It was a love-fest. Barely a year into Obama’s second term, however, there was anger on the table, served up by the detention of New York-based Indian diplomat Devyani Khobragade. Apart from that fracture, the relationship was also going nowhere in a time of policy paralysis. It wasn’t quite a cold war, but certainly a freeze. Since then, Narendra Modi has seemed to meet Obama more often than he has visited Parliament.
When I worked in New York, I met a senior Indian diplomat who used language that would never appear in a foreign service manual. Referring to the United States, he said, “We’ve got them by the balls.” What he meant was that India’s economic growth was its most formidable diplomatic tool. Let’s face it: The burgeoning middle-class in India and its consumer consciousness may well be buying credits with the global power.
In fact, if you were to graph the India-US relationship, the peaks and troughs would roughly approximate the performance of the Indian economy. That’s one reason the strategic dialogue also includes the US commerce secretary Penny Pritzker.
Beyond those obligatory words of bilateral bonhomie lies a transactional attitude. If the Indian market doesn’t bolster a sagging American economy, Washington’s attention will waver. This paradigm echoes what another Clinton running for president once used as a very effective campaign slogan, “It’s the economy, stupid.”"
First Post,India,,The biggest takeaway from Narendra Modi's US visit is impetus to nuclear power,"If everything goes well, the much-discussed Civilian Nuclear Cooperation Agreement of 2005 between India and the Unites States will take some concrete shape by 2017.
This, perhaps, is the most concrete outcome of the just concluded visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the United States. Following the summit meeting between Modi and US President Barack Obama, it was officially stated that “Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd (NPCIL) and US firm Westinghouse have agreed to begin engineering and site design work immediately for six nuclear power plant reactors in India and conclude contractual arrangements by June 2017”.
It is understood that these proposed reactors worth multi-billion dollars will no longer be stationed in Gujarat as decided earlier because of the land acquisition-hurdles. These will be shifted to Andhra Pradesh now. The NPCIL has already made a down payment for acquiring 2,000 acres (800 hectares) in Shrikakulam district for this purpose.. Apart from providing a huge impetus for further cementing of India-US ties, the decision to fulfill the promise of the civil nuclear agreement shows the Modi government’s commitment to meet India's growing energy needs while reducing reliance on fossil fuels. The BJP’s election manifesto in 2014 had discussed the importance of renewable energy sources such as solar, nuclear, hydel, ocean and wind for clean energy and minimal pollution. And the BJP, or for that matter the Modi government seems to have a point.
According to a World Nuclear Association (WNA) study, as of today, nuclear power provides over 11 percent of the world’s electricity as continuous, reliable base-load power, without carbon dioxide emissions. There are around 440 commercial nuclear power reactors operable in 31 countries, with over 380,000 MWe of total capacity. And around 65 more reactors are under construction. According to a June report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), improvements in nuclear construction times are now making climate goals more achievable than previously imagined. The report states that nuclear power plant grid connections 'doubled in 2015'.
There are 56 countries that operate a total of around 240 research reactors and a further 180 nuclear reactors power some 150 ships and submarines. Sixteen countries depend on nuclear power for at least a quarter of their electricity. France gets around three-quarters of its power from nuclear energy, while Belgium, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Sweden, Switzerland, Slovenia and Ukraine get a third or more. South Korea, Bulgaria and Finland normally get more than 30 percent of their power from nuclear energy, while in the US, UK, Spain and Russia, almost a fifth is from nuclear.
Over 45 countries — both developed and developing — are actively considering embarking on nuclear power programmes.
The Chinese government plans to increase nuclear generating capacity to 58 GWe with 30 GWe more under construction by 2020. Russia plans to increase its nuclear capacity to 30.5 GWe by 2020, using its world-class light water reactors. Several countries in Eastern Europe are currently constructing or have firm plans to build new nuclear power plants (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Turkey). Importantly, Sweden has abandoned its plans to prematurely decommission its nuclear power, and is now investing heavily in life extensions and updates. Early this year, it abolished “Nuclear Capacity Tax” on its existing reactors and will allow new reactors to be built to replace them. Hungary, Slovakia and Spain are all implementing or planning for life extensions on existing plants.
In Central and South America, countries that are promoting nuclear power include Cuba, Chile, Ecuador, Venezuela, Bolivia, Peru, and Paraguay. In Central and Southern Asia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka are setting up nuclear power plants (NPP). And in South East Asia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Malaysia, Singapore and Myanmar are going ahead with plans to set up NPPs. The same is the case with Australia and New Zealand.
It is, however, true that in some developed countries there have been demands to revisit the nuclear energy in the wake of the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011 in Japan, Germany and Japan are leading in this campaign for denuclearisation of energy. But then, the fact remains that with each passing day, the nuclear power is becoming safer and safer, thanks to the tremendous advances made in nuclear science.

Apart from taking care of the climatic and geographic features of the location of plants (such as earthquake-proneness and tsunami possibilities) into account, we have now what is called the passive safety system for nuclear reactors that keeps the reactors cool in the event of an accident. When a reactor shuts down, the radioactive byproducts of nuclear fission continue to generate heat. Failure to remove that heat can damage the reactor’s nuclear fuel and cause radiation, something that happened at Fukushima. Here, there was nothing wrong with the nuclear reactor as such; the problem occurred when following the tsunami the plant was shut down and there was no electricity for the safety system to remove the heat. Under the traditional safety system, the vulnerability of the nuclear plants is dependent on the availability of the electric power for cooling operations.
However, now we have what is called the “Passive Safety System”, which relies on gravitational forces to remove excess heat. After all, heat-removal is the basis for safety. In addition, passive safety systems reduce the number of valves and pumps in nuclear plants by at least 50 percent, thereby not necessitating a bigger space for a reactor, which, in turn, is less labour-intensive and vulnerable to sabotage. For instance, in our Kudankulam nuclear plants in Tamil Nadu, there are four channels of safety system, and these are sufficient for ensuring water supply for cooling of the reactor even if there is a black out for 24 hours.


Coming back to India’s nuclear energy plan, the target is to have 14.5 GWe nuclear capacities online by 2020. For this purpose, one needs light and heavy water reactors as well as fast reactors. In addition to the 21 online, six power reactors are under construction, of both indigenous and foreign design, including a 500 MWe prototype fast breeder reactor. This will take India's ambitious thorium programme to stage 2, and set the scene for eventual utilisation of the country's abundant thorium to fuel reactors.
Of course, there are some bottlenecks on the way.
The Modi government seems to have removed one of these bottlenecks — India’s unique nuclear liability laws of 2010 that talk of compensation in the event of nuclear accidents in a plant. As India is not self-sufficient in nuclear fuel and technology, it has to import them from outside. The universal practice is that in the event of an accident, it is the NPP that gives the compensation. No nuclear exporting country or farm undertakes the responsibility of safety, operations and maintenance of the NPP it has sold fuel and technology to. There has to be a national law or bilateral arrangement or international liability regime — such as the Vienna-based Convention on Supplementary Compensation (CSC) for Nuclear Damage or Paris Convention on Third Party Nuclear Liability in the Field of Nuclear Energy — for the exporter and importer to manage liability in case any nuclear accident takes place affecting a third party or the country.
Based on this principle, India passed a Liability Act in Parliament in 2010 that places responsibility for any nuclear accident with the operator, as is standard internationally, and limits total liability to around $450 million “or such higher amount that the Central government may specify by notification”. Operator liability is capped at Rs 1,500 crore ($285 million) or such higher amount that the Central government may notify, beyond which the Central government is liable. However, after compensation has been paid by the operator (or its insurers), clause 17(b) of the Indian Act allows the operator to have legal recourse to the supplier for up to 80 years after the plant starts up if in the opinion of an Indian court the “nuclear incident has resulted as a consequence of an act of supplier or his employee, which includes supply of equipment or material with patent or latent defects or sub-standard services”. This clause giving recourse to the supplier for an operational plant is contrary to international conventions and undermines the channeling principle fundamental to nuclear liability. Also, no limit is set on suppliers’ liability.
Obviously, all potential nuclear suppliers to India were unhappy. They wanted the law to be suitably amended, even though the fact remains that the stringent provision of 17(b) was incorporated under the pressure of the BJP, then in Opposition. The then Opposition leader in Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley was literally on a warpath for this stringent clause. That is why every country doing nuclear business with India, including Russia and France, was apprehensive about whether Modi would retrieve the situation now that Jaitley is his finance minister. But Modi seems to have done that.
The Modi government has ratified the CSC that the Manmohan Singh-led government had signed in 2010. The CSC, a free standing international nuclear liability regime, will give India access to international funding, beyond those available through national resources, to pay for damages in the event of a nuclear accident as per international practices. Nationally, the government has been working towards forming a nuclear insurance pool to cover the nuclear facilities. But for these steps, it is doubtful whether Modi’s visit to the US last week would have been a success story.
However, there are still other bottlenecks.
These include the powerful anti-nuclear lobby, cutting across the intelligentsia, political class and foreign-funded non-governmental organisations (NGO). The availability of the land for NPPs is equally formidable, with vested interests exploiting the situation through generation of fears over displacement of poor people, degradation of environment and doubts over nuclear safety."
First Post,India,,Narendra Modi's promises in US Congress will be questioned back home,"The 45-minute speech by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the joint session of the US Congress, acknowledged with 10 standing ovations and 69 rounds of applause, is one of his best so far.
This will go down in history with the Wembleys and Madison Square Gardens. It also tells us why Modi is one of the finest orators India has ever seen and an expert PR strategist. The prime minister has evolved his own method of conquering an international audience despite his perceived imperfections in the use of the English language.
The best way to win the confidence of your audience, particularly in a foreign soil, is to praise them. Praise them abundantly and do so again and again, till they fall flat on your feet. Commend their success and the good things they have done in the past for us. Keep mum on the perils and pain they have inflicted on us. Hence, Modi has done well by praising the US as a great democracy that has stood with India during the needy hours and pretending to ignore how the US has covertly funded terrorism in the region, particularly in Pakistan, that has always found its way across the border to Indian army posts and terrorist camps. It’s statesmanship. It touched upon a range of critical issues of bilateral cooperation between the world’s ‘largest and oldest democracies’ in the areas of energy security, terrorism, climate change and on the need to revamp international institutions (read as the UN) to meet the needs of present-day society situations. The hardened audience of the US Congress, including the US vice-president Joe Biden, responded to every word Modi spoke and acknowledged the prime minister’s observations with standing ovations and prolonged applauses — a feast for our eyes.
The attention Modi commands internationally, especially in the US where his bromance with his ‘friend Barack’ is now part of the local folklore, will make every Indian excited. That is especially so when one compares the prime minister with some of his predecessors who were men of few words and relatively low profiles. It doesn’t appear to make any difference to Modi whether he is speaking to the elite, hardened politicians of US Congress or an NRI crowd in Wembley. He does it the same way as he addresses a political rally in Patna. Also, it doesn’t bother him that the same country treated him as an outcast a few years ago and denied him entry.
Time heals everything.
“For my government, the Constitution is its real holy book. And, in that holy book, freedom of faith, speech and franchise, and equality of all citizens, regardless of background, are enshrined as fundamental rights,"" Modi said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses a joint meeting of Congress on Capitol Hill in Washington on Wednesday. PTI
Back home, this statement from Modi would have caught one group of filmmakers by surprise and a few dead souls turn in their graves, for they lost their lives for the same words of which Modi spoke — freedom of faith and speech.

As Modi spoke, a section of filmmakers were fighting for the same ideals of freedom of speech and art. On Wednesday, a group of film industry workers led by director, Anurag Kashyap, said they will fight in court against the decision of Censor board chief Pahlaj Nihalani, in order to exhibit the film Udta Punjab, the theme of which is the drug menace and lawlessness in Punjab. The artists said this was an attack on their freedom on creativity.
A review committee under Nihalani, who is proud to call himself a ‘Modi Bhakt’ or ‘Modi chamcha’ has asked the makers of the film to remove the word Punjab from the dialogues, acknowledge that the Modi government is fighting the drug menace in the state and cutting close-up scenes of characters in the film injecting drugs into their body. In all, there are 89 cuts the Censor board has ordered in the film, stating that the film maligns the name of the state of Punjab. Surely, Kashyap would not be too amused to hear about the freedom of expression part in Modi’s speech.

Neither would the souls of three liberal, rational writers/thinkers, MM Kalburgi, Govind Pansare and Narendra Dabholkar who were killed in the recent years. Left-wing politician and writer Pansare was shot on 16 February, 2015 in Kolhapur, Maharashtra, while Dabholkar was murdered on 20 August, 2013, in Pune. Kalburgi, a Kannada writer, was shot dead on 30 August, 2015, in Dharwad district in Karnataka. Last year, another Kannada writer, KS Bhagawan too received death threats from a right-wing group that threatened him for his controversial comments on the Ramayana and Mahabharata.
Instances of religious hostility (including the beef-killings) and frequent attacks on freedom of expression have indeed cast a shadow on the same values and ideals of which Modi spoke in the US Congress and the ten standing ovations and 69 rounds of applause do not seem to erase the ignominy on India’s civil society by a series of such incidents.
The very fact that the Central Bureau of Investigation suspects a link between the killings of three liberal thinkers, show that there is indeed reason for concern or concluding that such incidents are not mere coincidence.

Modi’s stance on the freedom of expression and faith is challenged in the US itself.
Recently, a Congress-mandated US Commission for International Religious Freedom's annual report had claimed that in 2015 India was on a ""negative trajectory"" as far as religious freedom is concerned. Religious tolerance ""deteriorated"" and religious freedom violations ""increased"", the report noted. Recently, US senator Ben Cardin, who is also on the Senate’s foreign relations committee, had attacked Modi ahead of the latter’s US visit saying India still needs to address issues of extrajudicial killings, human rights, religious intolerance, forced labour and human trafficking.
The prime minister has indeed pulled off another massively successful performance, this time in the ‘temple’ of the world’s oldest democracy. The respect and attention Modi has commanded will make every Indian feel proud and will benefit the country if the promises on the $45 billion in investment and commitments on civil nuclear cooperation translate to action and the US aids India’s claim to a stronger position in the UN.
But, the veracity of Modi’s claims on freedom of faith, speech and franchise that he ascribed to the ‘holy book’ will be questioned back home."
First Post,India,,How Twitter reacted to Narendra Modi's US Congress speech,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi delivered a speech at the US Congress on Wednesday that was dubbed as 'eloquent' and 'with the right amount of humour'. The prime minister referred to Pakistan, Yoga, terrorism, China, Siri and funnily enough, Walt Whitman as Twitteratti expressed their admiration for Modi's oratory skills.
“India is already assuming her responsibilities in securing the Indian Ocean region,” said Modi, “A strong India-US partnership can anchor peace, prosperity and stability from Asia to Africa and the Indian Ocean to the Pacific.”
In an indirect reference to China, he also touted India’s ""respect for global commons and for international rules and norms.""
Modi addressed US concerns on issues like intellectual property rights with humour. “Siri tells us that India’s ancient heritage of yoga has over 30 million practitioners in the US. It is estimated that more Americans bend for yoga than to throw a curve ball,” Modi said before landing his punchline.
“And, no Mr Speaker (Paul Ryan), we have not yet claimed intellectual property rights on yoga,” Modi said drawing laughter.
In a not-so-veiled reference to Pakistan, Modi said that terrorism was “incubated in India’s neighbourhood.”
“Not just in Afghanistan, but elsewhere in South Asia, and globally, terrorism remains the biggest threat,” said Modi. “In the territory stretching from west of India’s border to Africa, it may go by different names, from Lashkar-e-Taiba, to Taliban to IS.”
Modi's speech was applauded in the US Congress, but back home many took to Twitter to laud the speech and express their admiration for Modi.  However, not everyone took such a positive view on the Prime Minister's speech. "
The Economic Times,India,,Indo-US ties: Not quite brothers in ‘arms’ yet,"In his first policy speech, US ambassador to India Kenneth Juster described the US-India partnership as a “constant” in today’s turbulent world, whose potential impact on the Indo-Pacific region and beyond would be consequential. He talked about adding more substance to the relationship to make it stronger, more durable and flexible.
It’s time to get on with the programme, overcome anxieties, move beyond growing pains, stop doubting each other and start building in a “purposive manner”, Juster said. The speech both challenged and massaged his audience. He outlined an ambitious agenda, but only after locating the foundation of the partnership in the magic words of “respect” and “trust”. It was a good overview of what has been, and what can be, as the two sides discuss their plans for 2018, the year when both countries would still be free of election fever at least at the national level.
Juster identified defence cooperation as one of the five pillars on which the next phase of a durable partnership can rest. He hinted at major agreements this year in the areas of intelligence, surveillance, fighter aircraft production and co-development of next generation systems. The US is “committed to enhancing India’s security”.
To be sure, defence has always been the bright spot in the relationship, registering $15 billion in US arms sales over the last 10 years, a steady expansion of military exercises and new initiatives to discuss transfer of sophisticated technology. The designation of India in 2016 as a “major defence partner” is further expected to ease US export restrictions.
Last June, the Trump government approved the sale of Sea Guardian drones to India, the first such sale outside the charmed circle of Nato partners and treaty allies. The two sides are currently discussing pricing, payloads and technical specifications.
Sea Guardians will substantially increase the Indian Navy’s capabilities to watch over the oceans, since these drones can stay in the air for up to 20 hours.
The navy is also looking keenly at the F-18 Super Hornet offer from Boeing. If India decides in favour of the US platform, prospects for maritime cooperation and interoperability between the two navies immediately look better.
Buying a US platform would also mean finally closing the door on the awful phase when India came under US sanctions following the 1998 nuclear tests. It was a time when US bureaucrats found a new way every day to punish India.
These memories are buried deep but they resurface easily. While Americans can “move on”, Indians have aharder time doing so. It’s not enough to say that we should stop doubting each other, it’s important to prove it won’t happen again.

Defence is an area where the scale of ambition is matched only by the scale of problems. From trust issues to bureaucratic mismatches to legal requirements of the ginormous US military-industrial complex, to India’s procurement policies, the climb is tortuous. But alignment of two complex procurement systems is crucial for a more intense partnership.
India’s new Defence Procurement Policy (DPP) unveiled in 2016 was meant to quicken the acquisition process, but its focus on getting the lowest price and creating multiple layers of decision makers to prevent corruptionis expected to prolong the process.
Cara Abercrombie, former deputy assistant secretary of defence for South Asia, has written a detailed paper (‘Removing Barriers to US-India Defence Trade’, goo.gl/KbS2qY) pointing out the many disconnects between the two bureaucracies. First, Indiaand the US need an agreement that allows US companies to share classified industrial information with GoI and Indian companies. “India would be unwise to dismiss US demands for these formal assurances as unnecessary bureaucratic steps,” Abercrombie writes.
India’s tight deadlines for submittingproposals also create hurdles. While New Delhi takes years to decide whether to buy a particular weapon and expects multiple extensions of deadlines, it gives only 90 days after arequest for proposal is issued for companies to submit bids.
The US bureaucracy is no less cumbersome. It keeps an eye on all significant tech transfers and must approvethe bid after a long and mysterious inter-agency process. This results in missed deadlines and heartburn, which leads to erosion of goodwill.
Innovative bureaucrats have come up with solutions: they do a licence review before India issues the request.
But this necessarily means lower-end technology and disappointment. These workarounds will not be sustainable if things ramp up."
The Economic Times,India,,Building a durable US-India partnership,"The US-India partnership is as consequential as any relationship in international affairs. Our strategic partnership is designed to strengthen both countries and to have a beneficial impact on the Indo-Pacific region.
Over the last 17 years, we have laid a strong foundation for a strategic partnership that can have a significant, positive impact on the 21st century and beyond. It is now time to build upon this foundation in a flexible but purposive manner. We must move beyond our growing pains and help shape a stable architecture for the region.
We need to make sure that the India-US strategic partnership is a durable partnership. The longstanding commitment of the United States to a free, secure, and open Indo-Pacific has underpinned the stability and remarkable economic rise of this region – to the benefit of all of us. The United States will remain committed to this region – as we are to the rules-based international order – because our future is inextricably linked to it. We welcome India’s leadership with us in this venture – as partners bolstered by conviction and working with like-minded nations on a regional architecture to ensure that the Indo-Pacific – in the words of Secretary of State Tillerson – is increasingly a place of peace, stability, and growing prosperity, rather than one of disorder, conflict, and predatory economic policy.
Our cooperation on defense and counter-terrorism has been a key pillar of our partnership. US defense companies have already invested in India, producing components for complex defense systems. We seek to assist India’s efforts to build up its indigenous defense capabilities, as well as enhance the inter-operability of our two forces as major defense partners in the Indo-Pacific region.
We should put the same strategic lens on our economic relationship that we have applied to our defense relationship. A number of US companies have reported increasing difficulties conducting business in the largest market in the region – China. Accordingly, some companies are downgrading their operations there, while others are looking with great interest at alternative markets.
India can seize the strategic opportunity – through trade and investment – to become an alternative hub for US business in the Indo-Pacific region. Free and fair trade will support and accelerate Prime Minister Modi’s effort to improve India’s long-term growth in a sustained way. Moreover, “America First” and “Make in India” are not incompatible. Rather, investing in each other’s markets will increase our economic interactions and volume of trade, lead to collaboration on emerging technologies, and create jobs in both countries.
Accelerating the economic and regulatory reform process already begun by Prime Minister Modi will help ensure India is seen as an increasingly efficient, transparent, and well-regulated market, further promoting growth and development. Continued reforms and trade liberalization will also enable Indian products to more readily become part of the global supply chain, thereby accelerating job creation.
There are many benefits to growing our bilateral economic relationship and making India a regional hub for US business. We saw on display at the recent Global Entrepreneurship Summit in Hyderabad the critical and positive impact that an enabling environment for innovation has on a nation’s economy. America is a leader in entrepreneurship and innovation, and already has extensive linkages with India in the technology sector. Opening India’s market further to US trade and investment will spur India-US collaboration on many emerging technologies that will drive and protect our economies, including those related to advanced manufacturing and cyber security.
Greater US trade and investment, combined with a strong environment protecting intellectual property, will lead to increased flows of capital and sharing of intellectual know-how. Technological transformation requires constant upgrades, which occur when countries are involved in unimpeded international economic and data flows.
Increased openness to US goods and services, and an expanded presence of US companies, will also stimulate private sector investment in improved infrastructure and overall connectivity. As an example, US companies have innovative technologies that could support India’s ambitious goal to create 100 smart cities across the country.
Another area ripe for cooperation is energy. The United States is uniquely positioned to offer India a comprehensive energy partnership. This includes all forms of energy – coal; crude oil; natural gas; and nuclear power; as well as technology related to clean fossil fuels, smart grids, energy storage, and renewable resources. Last year the United States exported its first major shipment of crude oil to India. The United States can also help provide the supporting services, infrastructure, and technology that are necessary for India’s efforts to further develop domestic sources of energy and enhance energy security.
Increased heft in India-US economic relations would necessarily provide a broader and deeper, long-term US commitment to India and the Indo-Pacific region. This would complement our growing defense and counter-terrorism partnership, and moderate any policy differences that might arise along the way.
One constant in today’s turbulent world is – and always should be – the strength of the US-India partnership. While both India and the United States cherish our independence and sovereignty, the true value of our partnership is that it can better enable each of us to positively influence global affairs and achieve our greatest aspirations for the security and prosperity of our people."
Business Standard,India,,Bad news for Indian IT? Why proposed H-1B visa Bill has industry worried,"The proposed US Bill -- Protect and Grow American Jobs -- is riddled with ""onerous conditions"" and places ""unprecedented obligations"" on both Indian IT companies and clients using H-1B visas, software body Nasscom has cautioned.
Nasscom said it has flagged its concerns around visa-related issues in the US with the Senators, Congressmen and the administration, and will engage further in a dialogue over the next few weeks over the proposed legislation. 

The Bill proposes new restrictions to prevent abuse and misuse of H-1B visas. It tightens the definition of visa-dependent companies and imposes fresh restrictions in terms of minimum salary and movement of talent.
Apart from prescribing higher minimum wages, the Bill places the onus on clients that they will certify that the visa holder is not displacing an existing employee for a tenure of 5-6 years.
""That formulation has conditions which are extremely onerous and makes it very difficult for people to not just get the visa but also on how they can be used,"" R Chandrashekhar, President, National Association for Software and Services Companies (Nasscom) told PTI.


There is no doubt we have been seeing an increasingly negative environment and this is a part of the protectionist, anti-globalisation trend: R Chandrashekhar, President, Nasscom
The Bill has been passed by the House Judiciary Committee and is now headed for the US Senate.

""We do not know the exact timeline but we have been told it will come up early 2018,"" he said.
Chandrashekhar said another ""extreme concern"" is that ""in the name of protecting American jobs, this has been applied only to the so-called visa-dependent companies that translates to Indian companies"".
""There is no doubt we have been seeing an increasingly negative environment and this is a part of the protectionist, anti-globalisation trend,"" he said referring to a slew of measures taken by the US in the recent past, including increased visa scrutiny, premium visa processing being put on hold for a few months, etc.
Chandrashekhar also pointed out that the use of visas by Indian IT firms has fallen by 50 per cent in the last two years and that the number now stands below 10,000.
""It is below 10,000, which is a minuscule fraction of 85,000 visas (H-1B visas) issued every year... how such onerous restrictions on 12-15 per cent of the visas that are being issued protect American workers, certainly defies logic,"" he said.
Chandrashekhar explained that the Bill proposes to raise the minimum wage substantially to about $100,000 if the company has to be exempted from the labour certification requirements.
Also, the client deploying the H-1B visa worker will have to certify that no American worker will be displaced for the 5-6 year period.
Further, the software services provider will have to notify the US authorities if the client has displaced a worker, an obligation that is unprecedented, he said.
Chandrashekhar added that many of these changes were ""emotive and political"" rather than being based on ""economic arguments"".
He said that Nasscom has shared its concerns with both Indian and the US governments.
""...We will probably be having further interaction in next few months. In next couple of months, we expect to have interactions once again with the US authorities,"" he added."
Business Standard,India,,Trump admin seeks to stop spouses of H-1B visa holders from working in US,"US President Donald Trump's administration is set to propose revoking a rule that makes spouses of thousands of H1-B visa holders eligible to work while in the US, potentially complicating a major driver of technology jobs, the media reported.
Since 2015, the spouses of H-1B, or high-skilled, visa holders waiting for green cards have been eligible to work in the US on H-4 dependent visas, under a rule introduced by former President Barack Obama's administration, CNN reported on Friday. 

The tech sector is a major employer of H-1B visa holders.
But in a statement late Thursday, the Department of Homeland Security said that it intended to do away with the rule.
However, the department did not explain its reasons in the announcement, saying that it was only acting ""in light of"" the ""Buy American, Hire American"" executive order that Trump had signed in April.
The formal process to rescind the rule will still need to be initiated at a later date.
While changing the rule would not prevent spouses of H-1B holders from pursuing other avenues for work authorisation, it could deter a number of high-skilled immigrants from staying in the US if their spouses cannot easily find work.
As well as dropping the rule allowing spouses to work, the Department of Homeland Security statement mentioned plans for other changes to the H-1B visa programme, reports CNN.
They include revising the definition of what occupations are eligible for the programme ""to increase focus on truly obtaining the best and brightest foreign nationals"", which would be a standard potentially far above what is currently understood under the law.
The Obama-era rule allowing spouses to work already faces a legal challenge. A group called Save Jobs USA filed a lawsuit in April 2015 arguing that it threatens American jobs.
It has continued to press the case following Trump's election, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions has said in the past that the H-4 rule ""hurts American workers"".
The administration's plans to overhaul the H-1B programme has caused particular alarm in India, which accounts for 70 per cent of all H-1B workers.
The H-1B is a common visa route for highly skilled foreigners to find work at companies in the US. It is valid for three years, and can be renewed for another three years.
It is a programme that's particularly popular in the tech community, with many engineers vying for one of the programme's 85,000 visas each year.
In October, the government said it was toughening up the process for renewing the visa. The US Citizenship and Immigration Services instructed its officers to review requests for renewal as thoroughly as they would initial visa applications."
Business Standard,India,,"US panel votes to hike pay of H-1B visa holders from $60,000 to $90,000 ","A key Congressional committee has voted to pass a legislation that proposes to increase the minimum salary of H-1B visa holders from $60,000 to $90,000 and imposes a number of restriction on the work visa popular among IT professionals from India.
The Protect and Grow American Jobs Act (HR 170) introduced by Courts, Intellectual Property and the Internet Subcommittee Chairman Darrell Issa - was passed by the House Judiciary Committee during a markup hearing today morning. 

The bill now heads to the full House for necessary action.
A similar version of the bill needs to be passed by the Senate before it can be sent to the White House for the US President Donald Trump to be signed into law.

Given the sharp differences that the Democratic and Republican lawmakers and the White House have on various aspects of immigration reform including H-1B, the Congressional passage of the bill and its becoming a law as of now appears to be a tall order.
The bill prohibits H-1B dependent employers from replacing American workers with H-1B employees, there are no longer any exceptions.
It also lengthens the no-layoff policy for H-1B dependent employers and their client companies for as long an H-1B employee works at the company, which means they cannot layoff equivalent US workers.
For H-1B dependent employers to be exempted from the requirement that US workers be recruited first, the Protect and Grow American Jobs Act dramatically increases the salary requirements for H-1B workers.
""They must pay the lower of $135,000which is indexed for inflation or the average wage for the occupation in the area of employment, but with a floor of $90,000,"" said a media release issued by the House Judiciary Committee.
NASSCOM president R Chandrashekhar in a statement said that HR 170, as adopted by House Judiciary Committee, would harm US businesses and impose an extraordinary amount of bureaucratic red tape on a programme that contributes greatly to US prosperity.
""It also could disrupt the marketplace, threaten thousands of US jobs, and stifle US innovation by unfairly and arbitrarily targeting a handful of companies who used just 16 per cent of the new H-1B visas in FY 2016 while imposing no new requirements on the vast majority of companies that use the visas to do the same exact same things,"" Chandrashekhar said.
Defending the passage of the bill, Congressman Issa said lawmakers have a responsibility to ensure that H-1B is not abused by those misusing it to outsource jobs and undercut American workers.
""Unfortunately, the loopholes left open in H-1B have allowed a small handful of companies to game the system and crowd out employers who need the limited slots available to bring in the best and brightest individuals from around the world,"" he said.
""The Protect and Grow American Jobs Act is a common-sense update that will go a long way to protecting American workers while helping companies have better access to the talent they need to grow their businesses and create new jobs here in America,"" Issa said.
Congressman Bon Goodlatte, Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said the immigration programmes must put American workers and nation's interests first, and ""unfortunately"" that is not the case currently with the H-1B visa programme.
""The Protect and Grow American Jobs Act makes much-needed reforms to the H-1B programme to curtail abuse of the system and protect American workers,"" he said.
NASSCOM strongly disagrees with the US lawmakers.
""Unfortunately, this legislation is being driven by myths, not reality. US government data show very significant shortages of high skill talent around the country. The data show that the high skill visa programmes are not a major cause of US unemployment, and IT specialists working on temporary visas are not cheap labour,"" said Chandrashekhar.
According to the US Bureau of Labour Statistics, across the US economy, approximately 20 million people per year lose their jobs due to reasons not linked to hiring H-1B employees.
Compared to that, the annual number of H-1Bs granted to the top 10 India-centric IT service companies in 2016 was only a tiny fraction of the US workforce, he said.
According to a study by the Pew Research Center, based on fiscal 2016 data from US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) data, for eight of the top 10 India-centric IT companies, the average salary for workers on H-1B visas was higher than the median salary for US citizens in computer and mathematical jobs, Chandrashekhar argued.
""Employers who use the H-1B programme are highly regulated and scrutinised already, and NASSCOM member companies abide by all applicable laws and regulations.
""According to the US government, the rate of compliance problems is very low, and the overwhelming majority of problems occur at American companies with fewer than 50 employees,"" he said.
Chandrashekhar said NASSCOM continues to support efforts to root out any fraud or abuse in the H-1B system.
""Quite simply, our members do not deserve to be treated differently from their American or European counterparts,"" he said."
Hindustan Times,India,,"India-US ties: 2017 was ‘Kabhi khushi, kabhi gam’. How will 2018 pan out?","In India-US?ties, Pakistan is likely to be the main foreign policy issue between the two countries as New Delhi will look for follow-up actions by the Trump administration on its tough rhetoric to force Islamabad to act decisively against terrorists operating from its soil. As a van carrying a group of reporters to the White House straightened after making a right, a muted yell went up from a corner: “They hugged”. They being Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his host President Donald Trump. 
They would hug two more times before the day was out. It was June 26, 2017.
They have met several more times since, and hugged.The two leaders and the countries have moved past the usual awkwardness that comes dealing with a new US administration, especially one led by such an unpredictable president. Officials on both sides say the leaders share a close rapport.
They will need every bit of that, and more, as their governments deal with trade and immigration — read H-1B visas — which are likely to emerge as top challenges confronting relations in 2018, the year Modi shifts into election mode for the 2019 general election and Trump gets his administration moving.
Pakistan is likely to be the main foreign policy issue between the two countries as New Delhi will look for follow-up actions by the Trump administration on its tough rhetoric to force Islamabad to act decisively against terrorists operating from its soil, across both its eastern and western borders.
Trade, however, is likely to pose the first challenge, starting as early as a second past December 31 midnight, and into the new year, with the lapsing of the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP), a programme that allows selected developing countries to export some products duty-free to the US.
The last extension, in 2015, came nearly two years after the expiration date, with retroactive effect. There is no word yet on the administration’s plans or Congress, which has to legislate the renewal. This could take anything “around six months or more”, said an official on condition of anonymity.
India is GSP’s top beneficiary, and hopes to continue the preferential treatment. It exported goods worth $4.7 billion to the US under GSP in 2016, more than any other country and equal in worth to nearly 10% of its exports to the US under normal trade relations of $41.36 billion.
During that period, India expects to come under pressure, multiple sources have said, to yield ground on some continuing market issues such as removing the price cap on stent devices used in heart surgeries, opening up its poultry sector to US imports, and implementing a WTO adjudication verdict.
India will have to pay a price if wants to continue on the list — withstanding pressure from some critics who have argued India doesn’t need that kind of help any longer — and which will not be easy for Modi to pay, specially so close to a general election.
There are other trade issues between the two countries, such as the matter of trade deficit, that has been alleviated to an extent by Indian purchase of US crude and gas and a large order of civilian use aircraft. But market access and related issues have been an irritant for a while, and 2018 might be no different.
There will be then the issue of immigration, specially the H-1B short-term work visa programme under which US companies can hire foreign workers for speciality jobs. Indians account for 70% of all H-1B visas — 87% of whom, a point often missed, are hired by US companies, and only 13% by Indian firms.
Trump, a critic of the programme, and his administration have already changed some aspects of it such as redefining speciality to raise the bar, and a slew of changes expected in 2018 through administrative and legislative measures could change it beyond recognition.
“Indian companies will be hit,” said an Indian official speaking on background, “but we feel Indian professionals hoping to work in the US could remain unharmed or may even benefit.” Trump’s resolve to switch to merit-based immigration, the official said, could benefit Indian professionals.



Pakistan will be a key issue, and one on which India would hold the US to its words, specially the tough language used by Trump and his top officials.

A failure of the Trump administration to match deeds to its words would “underscore India's longstanding concern that the US government insists on maintaining workable relations with Islamabad despite Pakistan's continued support for terrorists that target both Americans and Indians”, said Michael Kugelman, a South Asia expert with Wilson Center, a leading US think tank.

Year 2018 will pose other challenges — such as the continuing clash of Modi’s and Trump’s “Make in India” and “Buy American, Hire American” vision for spurring domestic manufacturing, but overall, experts and officials said, the relationship is headed north, all conditions remaining the same.

2017 rewind

The leaders: Prime Minister Narendra Modi was among the first world leaders to speak to President Donald Trump after his inauguration, ahead even of Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, a close US ally.

They went on to strike a close personal rapport, based on several phone calls and at least three meetings, including one in the White House on June 26 that stretched over several hours, and included a reception for the visitors thrown by first lady Melania Trump.

The convergence: Trump’s tough talking on Pakistan’s record on counter-terrorism and explicit warnings that the US will “no longer be silent” aligned with India’s long-standing frustration with cross-border terrorism backed by Islamabad.

The Trump administration and New Delhi have identical views on China’s predatory One Belt, One Road initiative, and the two countries raised their concerns on multiple platforms. Indo-Pacific, a phrase used to describe the region is commonly used by both, to much irritation in Beijing.

On Afghanistan, the US wants India to step up its cooperation under Trump’s new South Asia strategy, mostly in the economic and infrastructure sectors.

The dissonance: Chiefly, trade and immigration — H-1B. The Trump administration is investigating India and other countries with whom the US is running massive trade deficits. India has sought to close the gap with massive purchases of American crude and gas, and other big-ticket items such as civilian aircraft.

H-1B was going to be a major irritant, as Trump had indicated as a candidate, and it was, with the administration singling out Indian IT companies with US operations for criticism, alleging they were “gaming” the system. Trump has ordered a review of the programme and every visiting Indian official has said they raised the issue “very strongly” with their American counterpart.

Modi’s “Make in India” and Trump’s “Buy Americans, Hire American” have similar, clashing objectives of boosting domestic manufacturing through inward-looking incentives. But they have so far lived in happy co-existence.

The Economic Times,India,,"How Indian Americans have failed to make a strong impact on US mainstream culture 

","Come August, the India Day Parade will wind its way down New York City. The commemoration of India’s Independence Day is also a salute of sorts to the achievements of Indians in the US. Like every year, it is most likely to have the ambience of an Indian wedding — colourful ethnic costumes and Bollywood song-and-dance sequences. But the parade, held in NYC since 1981, will also highlight that it is still not a big draw for non-Indian New Yorkers to connect with Indian culture. In short, it will be another lost opportunity to display India’s soft power in the heart of the US. 

The community has done well in academia and also in the corporate world. Prominent Indian-American writer Chitra Divakaruni sees writers who are choosing the immigrant experience genre getting recognised. “Indian-American writers such as late Bharati Mukherjee, Deepak Chopra, Jhumpa Lahiri, myself, Mindy Kaling and Akhil Sharma have won prizes and have been on bestseller lists. Our books are taught in colleges and universities and are book-club favourites. So I would say we are making a distinct mark on American society.” But the fact remains that these are more exception that the rule. The India diaspora has not been able to make a larger impact on the psyche of the US mainstream culture, when compared with, say, the Chinese Americans. 

Language Barrier 
Students in American higher education institutions looking to study foreign languages have little or no options from India. There are few offerings of Hindi, Urdu or Sanskrit and even fewer of languages such as Bengali and Tamil. But Chinese and Japanese are among the top 10 foreign languages Americans learn in schools and colleges. In movies, music, and theatre, the Indian-American immigrant experience is still a long way from making an impact in mainstream popular entertainment. It is, in fact, quite ironic that the meatiest role in American TV so far was bagged not by an Indian-American actor but by Bollywood’s crossover star, Priyanka Chopra, in TV drama thriller Quantico. But even such moments are few and far between. 
Swati Ali, a New York-based independent film-maker, says the underlying differences in culture between the two countries could be the reason for the poor Indian representation. “Internationally, after Hollywood, India probably has the biggest footprint in cinema. However, we have still not been able to capture the imagination of America, like we have in other countries. The reason for this could be a dramatic difference in culture and the tone/style of movies in both countries. The most common stereotype with regard to the average Indian American is that he/she is a techie.” 

Mira Nair’s Salaam Bombay!; Slumdog Millionaire and Manoj “Night” Shyamalan have had major success in Hollywood. But such accolades and recognition continue to be rare for films with Indian themes. Even Shyamalan has not explored Indian themes. 
Arts & Entertainment 
Vishakha Desai, a scholar of Asian art, who was the president and CEO of the influential Asia Society from 2004 to 2012 and is now an adjunct professor at Columbia University, puts things into perspective: all Asian-Americans suffer from a lack of representation in arts and entertainment in the US. “The first generation of Indian immigrants focused on professional degrees in science, engineering and medicine. Plenty of second generation Indian Americans are exploring more diverse fields, including arts and culture. But like other Asian-Americans, they also suffer from stereotyping of their ethnicity or simply from exclusion.” 

One Asian group that has done comparatively well on this front is the Chinese-American community. There is, of course, an historic advantage. The Chinese started arrived in the US in the 18th Century, while the large wave of Indian immigration began in the early 19th Century, says Aroon Shivdasani, a founding member of the Indo-American Arts Council, a New York city organisation promoting artists of Indian origin in North America. Tradition has remained important for Chinese and Indians, irrespective of their employment and education, she says. However, the basic difference has been that “as part of getting settled, the Chinese popularised their food and festivals wherever they could. Early Indian immigrants concentrated on employment and education, considering the arts an indulgence.” 

Indian-American immigrants are among the highest per capita earners, and have deep pockets. But they have arguably not encouraged their children to push their heritage through art, music, theatre, dance, film. 

Arvind Manocha, 46, was an exception. The music lover grew up in Ohio listening to everything from Indian ragas to Beethoven to Queen. Manocha is now president and CEO of Wolf Trap Foundation for the Performing Arts, a non-profit organisation that partners with the US National Park Service to provide concert and performing art facilities in Virginia. 
This background has helped him grasp cultural nuances. Indian Americans can be more visible in music and arts only if their aspirations are nurtured, he says. “And in our community, it’s very important for the parents to see their children in the arts, than just the children themselves.” Manocha was lucky as his parents supported his career choice. “I have often been the only Indian American in the organisations in which I’ve worked.” 
In Hollywood
Farhad Ahmed Dehlvi, a Los Angelesbased cinematographer who was part of the camera crew of The Dark Knight Rises and Life of Pi, says a difference will be felt when more talented people of Indian origin start working not just as actors in Hollywood, but also start getting involved in behind-the-scenes roles. “We still have a long way to go, but I see more diverse voices in Hollywood.” 

But till that happens, Indian Americans in US movies will continue to be the stereotyped Gujaratis, with caricatured accents, running convenience stores, or nerds who work as computer programmers — much like the characters played by Kal Penn in the film series Harold & Kumar or Kunal Nayyar as Dr Raj Koothrappali in the TV series The Big Bang Theory.
